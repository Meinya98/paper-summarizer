39921842,"Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, primarily driven by APC mutation and AXIN degradation via Tankyrase, contributes significantly to colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and metastasis. The accumulation of β-catenin, resulting from the dysregulated ubiquitination, underscores the need for alternative therapeutic strategies targeting Tankyrase and β-catenin. This present study explores microbial metabolites as a source of novel anti-cancer agents, leveraging their unique bioactivity and structural diversity, often exhibiting superior target specificity and lower toxicity than synthetic drugs. Through a computational drug discovery pipeline, a large library of 27641 microbial metabolites was initially screened based on multiple drug-likeliness criteria, resulting in the selection of 2527 compounds. Among the screened compounds, an integrated computational workflow comprising molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MDS), MM/PBSA analysis, and Principal component analysis (PCA) identified Terreustoxin I (T1) as a potential Tankyrase inhibitor. In contrast, compound 10- phenyl-[12]-cytochalasin Z16 (B1) demonstrated a strong binding affinity within the β-catenin active site. Under physiological conditions, these lead compounds were evaluated for conformational stability, binding efficacy, and dynamic behavior. Additionally, ADMET profiling, physiochemical properties, and bioactivity score predictions confirmed the identified compounds' pharmacokinetic suitability and reduced toxicity profile. In silico, cytotoxicity predictions showed significant activity against SW480 and HCT90 colorectal cell lines, with additional anti-neoplastic and anti-leukemic properties, strengthening their candidacy as effective anti-cancer agents. These findings provide a foundation for further experimental validation and development of novel CRC therapies with improved safety and efficacy potential."
39921807,"Cancer cells can modulate the expression of many proteins that are essential for supporting their uncontrolled proliferation. Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is ubiquitously expressed in most cell types and participates in controlling many survival pathways. Cancer cells utilize HSP90 in order to prolong their survival, thus they tend to overexpress it. Based on its importance for cancer cells, we aim to investigate the molecular mechanisms that link HSP90 inhibition in colon cancer cells with oxidative stress and mitochondrial stress-related regulators."
39921789,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, and its treatment and prognosis vary greatly among subgroups. Therefore, it is necessary to identify prognostic factors associated with the biological heterogeneity of CRC in order to improve patients' survival expectations."
39921761,"Ingenol mebutate (IM), a diterpene ester derived from Euphorbia species, has demonstrated promising anticancer properties through direct cytotoxicity and immune modulation. Despite initial clinical success, its therapeutic use has been curtailed due to safety concerns, including potential links to increased skin cancer risk. This review evaluates the mechanisms of action, preclinical and clinical efficacy, safety, and limitations of IM as an anticancer agent, identifying areas for further development. A comprehensive literature review was performed using Google Scholar to identify English-language articles published from 2010 to 2023. Keywords included ""Ingenol mebutate,"" ""PEP005,"" and ""cancer therapy."" Articles focusing on IM's pharmacological properties, therapeutic mechanisms, clinical studies, and safety profile were included. IM exerts anticancer effects through dual mechanisms: mitochondrial dysfunction leading to necrosis and immune-mediated cytotoxicity via protein kinase C activation. Preclinical studies show efficacy against pancreatic, colorectal, and epithelial cancers and clinical studies have reported success in treating actinic keratosis and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Challenges include intense local skin reactions and safety concerns, particularly its potential association with increased skin malignancy risk. IM represents a promising therapeutic agent due to its rapid and potent anticancer effects. However, optimizing its safety profile and exploring advanced delivery methods are critical to expanding its clinical applications. Further studies are required to establish its long-term efficacy and potential for broader use in oncology."
39921753,"Metastasis and chemoresistance are often major challenges in advanced-stage colorectal cancer. Bufalin has a therapeutic effect on both metastasis and drug resistance, but how bufalin affects chemoresistance-mediated metastasis remains unclear."
39921520,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and liver metastasis is the leading reason for its mortality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are conclusively associated with the progression of various cancers, rendering the exploration of its specific mechanisms in colorectal cancer liver metastasis(CRLM) highly valuable. Combined with GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) databases and clinical data in our center, we found that high expression of circSATB1 is closely related to the progression of CRLM. Functionally, circSATB1 could significantly promote the metastatic ability of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circSATB1 facilitated the RNF25-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation of FKBP8, releasing its inhibitory effects on mTOR signaling. In this process, circSATB1 acted as a scaffold for RNF25-FKBP8 complexes. Additionally, circSATB1 could be packaged in exosomes and secreted from the CRC primary tumors into plasma. In conclusion, this study uncovered a new circSATB1 that acts as a potent promoter of CRLM and offers novel insights into the precision therapeutic strategies for CRLM."
39921517,"Industrial food processing has been linked to various health outcomes including cancer. To examine associations between the degree of food processing and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its sub-sites, data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) including 6155 incident CRC cases (n = 450,111 participants), were analyzed. Dietary intakes were assessed using baseline food frequency questionnaires. Foods were classified into culinary ingredients, unprocessed, processed (PFs), and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) according to the Nova classification. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for established CRC risk factors, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with a 10% increase in proportion of consumption (%g/d) of each Nova group. Substitution analysis examined the effect of replacing UPFs and PFs with unprocessed foods on CRC risk. A 10% increase in proportion of UPFs was associated with 6% higher CRC risk (95% CI:1.02-1.10). A positive association was also found between PFs and CRC risk (HR per 10% increase: 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.15]). Conversely, unprocessed food consumption was inversely associated with CRC risk (HR per 10% increase: 0.93[95% CI, 0.90-0.95]). Substitution of 10% of the overall proportion of the diet comprising UPFs or PFs with 10% unprocessed foods was associated with a decreased risk of CRC (HRUPFs: 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.97]; HRPFs: 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86-0.94]). In conclusion, UPF was positively associated with CRC risk while diets richer in unprocessed foods were associated with lower CRC risk. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which food processing affects CRC risk."

39921239,"It is increasingly recognized that young, chow-fed inbred mice poorly model the complexity of human carcinogenesis. In humans, age and adiposity are major risk factors for malignancies, but most genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) induce carcinogenesis too rapidly to study these influences. Standard strains, such as C57BL/6, commonly used in GEMMs, further limit the exploration of aging and metabolic health effects. A similar challenge arises in modeling periodontitis, a disease influenced by aging, diabesity, and genetic architecture. We propose using diverse mouse populations with hybrid vigor, such as the Collaborative Cross (CC) × ApcMin hybrid, to slow disease progression and better model human colorectal cancer (CRC) and comorbidities. This perspective highlights the advantages of this model, where delayed carcinogenesis reveals interactions with aging and adiposity. Unlike ApcMin mice, which develop cancer rapidly, CC × ApcMin hybrids recapitulate human-like progression. This facilitates the identification of modifier loci affecting inflammation, diet susceptibility, organ size, and polyposis distribution. The CC × ApcMin model offers a transformative platform for studying CRC as a disease of adulthood, reflecting its complex interplay with aging and comorbidities. The insights gained from this approach will enhance early detection, management, and treatment strategies for CRC and related conditions."
39921055,"Reprogrammed metabolism is an important basis of colorectal cancer (CRC) progression; however, its mechanisms remain unclear. This study illustrated a novel mechanism for long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) CRCMSL in CRC, which was identified as a CRC suppressor in our previous study."
39920888,The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the faecal immunochemical test (FIT) for colorectal cancer (CRC) in symptomatic patients with different levels of anaemia severity or the presence of iron deficiency.
39920741,Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks among the frequently occurring malignant neoplasms affecting the gastrointestinal tract. This study aimed to explore JAK-STAT signaling pathway related genes in CRC and establish a new prognostic model.
39920596,The aim of the study was to explore long-term experiences of transanal irrigation (TAI) in patients with major low anterior resection syndrome (LARS).
39920559,Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) of biomarkers is challenging due to the indirect impact on health outcomes and the lack of sufficient fit-for-purpose data. Hands-on guidance is lacking.
39920526,"The high occurrence and death rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) make it a major health concern. Recent studies have identified NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 2 (NSUN2), an RNA methyltransferase, as a key regulator in various tumor types. However, how exactly NSUN2-mediated m5C alteration affects CRC is still a mystery. This study seeks to understand how NSUN2 contributes to the growth and death of colorectal cancer cells. New tissue samples were taken in order to investigate NSUN2 expression in CRC. In vitro tests were performed to evaluate NSUN2's function. We used m5C-methylated-RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA stability experiments to find out how NSUN2 works on Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11, also called xCT). Downregulation of NSUN2 limits CRC cell growth and induces ferroptosis, as we show that NSUN2 was substantially expressed in CRC. In terms of the molecular mechanism, NSUN2 controls the translation and stability of SLC7A11 mRNA by regulating its m5C methylation. Functional tests show that SLC7A11 compensates for the NSUN2 knockdown-induced decrease in cell proliferation. Additionally, SLC7A11 overexpression restores ferroptosis to CRC cells after NSUN2 knockdown. These findings emphasize NSUN2's crucial role in modulating colorectal cancer cell growth and survival via SLC7A11, pointing to promising new therapeutic targets."
39920524,"We aimed to create a NK cell marker genes-based signature to predict immunotherapy response and prognosis in colorectal cancer. We integrated scRNA-seq data from four Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) samples and performed Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) based on 587 the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colorectal cancer samples to uncover NK cell-related genes. We identified 1080 NK cell-related core genes and 276 NK cell-related feature genes based on WGCNA and clustering and annotation of scRNA-seq data, respectively. Six key NK cell-related prognostic signature genes were obtained by univariate and LASSO regression analyses, including ADAM8, CTSD, CCL4, IL2RB, TTC38, and PLEK. Two validation cohorts from the GEO dataset, comprising 124 and 201 samples respectively, were used. The signature was significantly associated with overall survival and correlated with immune cell infiltration, immune and stromal scores, and immune checkpoint genes. Furthermore, the signature was associated with the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and T-cell receptor (TCR) scores. In conclusion, our study proposes a new prognostic signature based on NK cell marker genes, which may serve as a potential tool to predict overall survival and immunotherapy response for CRC patients."
39920491,"Germline pathogenic variants of the RPS20 (ribosomal protein S20) gene are suspected to be involved in the predisposition to familial colorectal cancer (CRC) with no DNA mismatch repair deficiency. RPS20 pathogenic variants are very rare with only five reported cases in the literature. We report in this work the retrospective germline analysis of RPS20 for 1035 consecutive patients with a personal and/or familial history suggestive of hereditary predisposition to CRC. Within this series, a pathogenic variant in known CRC genes was found in 15% of cases and we describe one RPS20 loss-of-function variant (NM_001146227.1:c.115_116del, p.(Leu39Aspfs*33)). This frameshift is the first reported de novo variant in CRC, it was identified in in a female patient diagnosed with rectal cancer at the age of 35, 11 adenomatous polyps in 5 years and breast cancer at the age of 43. RPS20 has an intriguing role in oncogenesis, acting as an oncogene or tumour suppressor depending on the context, and is also involved in Diamond-Blackfan anemia via gain of function or dominant negative variants. This is therefore a complex gene for genetic counselling and, given the rarity of RPS20 pathogenic variants, we emphasise the need to collect data to clarify the phenotypic spectrum of RPS20-associated cancers and thus improve management."
39920335,"Cancer driver mutations are defined by their high prevalence in cancers and presumed rarity in normal tissues. However, recent studies show that positive selection in normal epithelia can increase the prevalence of some cancer drivers. To determine their true cancer-driving potential, it is essential to evaluate how frequent these mutations are in normal tissues and what are their phenotypes. Here, we explore the bioavailability of somatic variants by quantifying age-related mutational burdens in normal human colonic epithelium using immunodetection in FFPE samples (N = 181 patients). Positive selection of variants of tumour suppressor genes PTEN and ARID1A associates with monoallelic gene loss as confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis and changes in their downstream effectors. Comparison of the mutational burden in normal tissue and colorectal cancers allows quantification of cancer driver potency based on relative representation. Additionally, immune exclusion, a cancer hallmark feature, is observed within ARID1A-deficient clones in histologically normal tissue. The behaviour resulting from haploinsufficiency of PTEN and ARID1A demonstrates how somatic mosaicism of tumour suppressors arises and can predispose to cancer initiation."
39921843,"Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a significant public health concern due to its annual epidemics and potential for global pandemics. Despite the availability of countermeasures such as vaccines and antiviral treatments, their effectiveness is often questioned due to the emergence of novel strains with antiviral resistance and the variable efficacy of influenza vaccines compared to other vaccines. Traditionally, influenza vaccination strategies have focused on matrix, neuraminidase, and nucleoproteins. In this study, considering the crucial roles of HA and RdRp (PA, PB1, and PB2) of Influenza A, a reverse vaccinology approach is put forth in designing a possible promising antigenic protein toward the development of vaccines against H1N1 viruses. With the development of immunoinformatics approach, one can design/construct potential candidates for vaccine formulation against IAV with the epitope segments identified based on B- and T-cell recognition linked via adjuvants like EAAAK, GPGPG, and AAY linkers. Computational assessments of physicochemical properties, antigenicity, immunogenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity predictions, conducted to evaluate the potential of designed vaccine construct, indicated high antigenicity and potential interactions with immune receptors. Molecular docking of the vaccine construct with human immune receptors (MHCI, MHCII, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8) followed by molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated stable dynamics with strong binding affinity. The computational immune response modeling with multiple dosages suggested significant immune activation by this construct against IAV. In essence, these findings highlight the potential immune property of the vaccine construct, and put forth the need of thorough preclinical assessments in transforming this construct as a vaccine against the challenging IAV pathogens."
39921763,"Neuroinflammation and abnormal energy metabolism have been shown to significantly contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Adenylate kinase 5 (AK5), an enzyme predominantly expressed in the brain regulates ATP metabolism, has an unclear role in energy metabolism and neuroinflammation in AD."
39921750,"Congenital mesoblastic nephromas (CMN) are histologically classified into classical, cellular, and mixed subtypes. Most cellular CMNs harbor ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusions, and classic and mixed CMNs harbor EGFR internal tandem duplications (EGFR-ITDs). Classic CMNs are considered benign, whereas recurrent or metastatic diseases occur in the cellular subtypes. Direct identification of mutations is desirable for an accurate diagnosis. However, molecular genetic analyses cannot be performed in a number of histopathology laboratories. This study aimed to investigate a surrogate marker for the accurate histological classification of CMN."
39921733,"Protodioscin (PRO) is a furostanol saponin with antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties. However, there is no proof against nociception and diarrhea. The study aims to investigate the antinociceptive and antidiarrheal effects of PRO, comparing its efficacy with diclofenac sodium (DFS) and loperamide (LOP) using in vivo and in silico methods. Antinociceptive activity was evaluated using the acetic acid-induced writhing and formalin-induced paw licking tests, and antidiarrheal effects were assessed via castor oil-induced diarrhea in mice. Mice were divided into groups receiving PRO (2.5 and 10 mg/kg, p.o.), DFS (25 mg/kg, p.o.), LOP (3 mg/kg, p.o.), or combinations. Molecular docking studies were conducted on COX-1, COX-2 enzymes, and the Mu-opioid receptor (MOR), with toxicity predictions performed for safety profiling. In vivo results demonstrated that PRO significantly (p < 0.05) reduced pain and diarrhea in animals. PRO at 10 mg/kg, showed comparable efficacy to DFS and LOP (25 and 3 mg/kg) in both models. Molecular docking revealed that PRO had stronger binding affinities with COX-1 (‒10.0 kcal/mol), COX-2 (‒9.6 kcal/mol) enzymes, and MOR (‒7.7 kcal/mol) compared to standard drugs. Toxicity predictions indicate PRO is relatively safe in some toxicity parameters. PRO exhibits significant antinociceptive and antidiarrheal activities comparable to DFS and LOP, making it a promising natural alternative for managing pain and diarrhea. Additional clinical trials and pharmacokinetic assessments are required to evaluate its long-term safety for use."
39921600,"Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated interactions between genes in the mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear genomes. Imperfect interactions following mitonuclear incompatibility may lead to reduced fitness. MtDNA introgressions across species and populations are common and well documented. Various strategies may be expected to reconcile mitonuclear incompatibility in hybrids or admixed individuals. African admixed cattle (Bos taurus × B. indicus) show sex-biased admixture, with taurine (B. taurus) mtDNA and a nuclear genome predominantly of humped zebu (B. indicus). Here, we leveraged local ancestry inference approaches to identify the ancestry and distribution patterns of nuclear functional genes associated with the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process in the genomes of African admixed cattle. We show that most of the nuclear genes involved in mitonuclear interactions are under selection and of humped zebu ancestry. Variation in mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) may have contributed to the recovery of optimal mitochondrial function following admixture with the regulation of gene expression, alleviating or nullifying mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, some nuclear mitochondrial genes with enrichment in taurine ancestry may have originated from ancient African aurochs (B. primigenius africanus) introgression. They may have contributed to the local adaptation of African cattle to pathogen burdens. Our study provides further support and new evidence showing that the successful settlement of cattle across the continent was a complex mechanism involving adaptive introgression, mtDNA-CN variation, regulation of gene expression, and selection of ancestral mitochondria-related genes."

39921490,"Vertebrate embryogenesis requires the precisely timed specification of 3 germ cell layers- ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm- which give rise to tissues and organs in the developing organism. The tumor suppressor gene NF2, moesin-ezrin-radixin like (MERLIN) tumor suppressor (Nf2) is expressed in all 3 germ layers during mouse development and its homozygous deletion causes embryonic lethality. People with heterozygous NF2 mutations typically develop Schwann cell tumors, especially vestibular schwannoma, but the specific role of NF2 in human embryonic development is unclear. Here, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are used to demonstrate that NF2 is essential for endoderm specification and formation in humans. Although endoderm differentiation is not impaired in hiPSCs with heterozygous NF2 mutation, NF2 knockout (NF2-/-) abolished the capacity to form endoderm in vitro, confirmed by loss of expression of endoderm-related genes and proteins, or teratomas in vivo. This defect is mediated by the nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a transcription co-activator regulating lineage fate via the Hippo pathway and subsequent YAP1-mediated shutdown of Activin/Nodal signaling. Endoderm formation can be rescued via YAP1 knockdown or forced re-expression of NF2 in NF2-/- cells. Taken together, the essential role of NF2 during endoderm specification in human embryogenesis as a regulator of YAP1 is reported."
39921431,"Tailored droplet generation is crucial for droplet microfluidics that involve samples of varying sizes. However, the absence of precise predictive models forces droplet platforms to rely on empiricism derived from extensive experiments, underscoring the need for comprehensive modeling analysis. To address this, a novel customized assembled centrifugal step emulsifier (CASE) is presented by incorporating a ""jigsaw puzzles"" design to efficiently acquire large-scale experimental data. Numerical simulations are utilized to analyze fluid configurations during step emulsification, identifying a key connection tube that determines droplet size. By training and verifying with the experimental and simulation datasets, a comprehensive theoretical model is established that allows for the preliminary design of the droplet size and generation frequency with an average error rate of 4.8%, successfully filling a critical gap in existing field. This predictive model empowers the CASE to achieve all-in-one functionality, including droplet pre-design, generation, manipulation, and on-site detection. As a proof of concept, multiscale sample analysis ranging from nanoscale nucleic acids to microscale bacteria and 3D cell spheroids is realized in the CASE. In summary, this platform offers valuable guidance for customized droplet generation by centrifugal step emulsifiers and promotes the adoption of droplet microfluidics in biochemical assays."
39921398,"Viruses exert a profound influence on both human health and the global ecosystem, yet they remain largely unexplored. Precise taxonomic classification of viral sequences is essential for discovering novel viruses, elucidating their functions, and assessing their implications for public health and environmental monitoring. Traditional taxonomy methods based on genome references are limited by the vast number of unexplored viruses, rapid mutation rates, and high genetic diversity. Additionally, highly imbalanced species distribution and significant variances in inter-species genomic distances across taxonomic units pose challenges to classifier training. Conceptualizing genomic sequences as sentences in a natural language, large language models provide novel approaches for extracting intrinsic viral genome characteristics. In this study, we introduce ViTax, a virus taxonomy classification tool powered by HyenaDNA, a large language foundation model for long-range genomic sequences at single nucleotide resolution. ViTax integrates supervised prototypical contrastive learning to address the highly imbalanced distributions across various taxonomic clades and demonstrates superior performance to current leading methods in virus taxonomy, particularly significant for long sequences. Moreover, ViTax designs a belief mapping tree using the Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm to adaptively assign a sequence to the lowest taxonomy clade with confidence. For the open-set problem, where sequences belong to novel and unexplored genera, ViTax can adaptively assign them to a higher level of known taxonomy with outstanding performance. These capabilities make ViTax a robust tool for advancing the accuracy and reliability of viral taxonomy classification. The code is available at https://github.com/Ying-Lab/ViTax."
39921383,"This study aims to identify the risk factors associated with clinical outcomes and the proteomic changes in organs related to fatal SARS-CoV-2 infection within the super-elderly population. This retrospective analysis included all elderly individuals with COVID-19 admitted to the Second Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from December 2022 to January 2023. The follow-up period ended on March 30, 2023. During this time, epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, and outcome data were analyzed descriptively. Proteomic sequencing was performed on super-elderly patients who died from COVID-19 at different stages of the disease. A total of 352 elderly COVID-19 patients, with a mean age of 89.84 ± 8.54 years, were included in this study. During a median follow-up period of 98 days, 79 patients died. Deceased patients were older and more likely to have cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, with a lower prevalence of lipid-lowering therapy. The number of deaths in the acute and post-acute phases were 34 and 45, respectively. Proteomics data suggest that the immune systems of patients who died in the acute phase underwent a more rapid and severe onslaught. Patients in the post-acute phase showed higher levels of viral genome replication and a more robust immune response. However, the over-activation of the immune system led to systemic organ dysfunction. Effective management of comorbidities may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 in super-elderly patients. The continuous replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its subsequent impact on the immune system are critical determinants of survival time in this demographic."
39921370,"In patients with phyllodes tumors of the breast, the presence of mediator of RNA polymerase II transcription subunit 12 homolog mutations (MED12m) and a history of previous fibroadenoma may predict better outcomes. To aid in the prognostication of malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast (B-MPT), we assessed the prognostic value of fibroadenoma-like areas (supposed to have stemmed from a pre-existing fibroadenoma) and MED12m, in patients with resected primary B-MPTs."
39921335,"A variety of classical machine learning (ML) approaches has been developed over the past decade aiming to individualize drug dosages based on measured plasma concentrations. However, the interpretability of these models is challenging as they do not incorporate information on pharmacokinetic (PK) drug disposition. In this work we compare drug plasma concentraton predictions of well-known population PK (PopPK) modeling with classical machine learning models and a newly proposed scientific machine learning (MMPK-SciML) framework. MMPK-SciML allows to estimate PopPK parameters and their inter-individual variability (IIV) using multimodal covariate data of each patient and does not require assumptions about the underlying covariate relationships. A dataset of 541 fluorouracil (5FU) plasma concentrations as example for an intravenously administered drug and a dataset of 302 sunitinib and its active metabolite concentrations each as example for an orally administered drug were used for analysis. Whereas classical ML models were not able to describe the data sufficiently, MMPK-SciML allowed us to obtain accurate drug plasma concentration predictions for test patients. In case of 5FU, goodness-of-fit shows that the MMPK-SciML approach predicts drug plasma concentrations more accurately than PopPK models. For sunitinib, we observed slightly less accurate drug concentration predictions compared to PopPK. Overall, MMPK-SciML has shown promising results and should therefore be further investigated as a valuable alternative to classical PopPK modeling, provided there is sufficient training data."
39921258,"Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic heart defect in neonates. While there is compelling evidence of genetic contribution to the etiology of TOF, the contribution of noncoding variants to the development of the defect remains unexplored. Potentially damaging noncoding de novo variants (NC DNVs) were detected from 141 Chinese nonsyndromic TOF trios (CHN-TOF) and compared to those detected in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC). Bioinformatic analyses on noncoding and previously detected coding DNVs were performed to identify developmental pathways affected in TOF. Chinese but not PCGC TOF patients showed a notably increased burden of putative damaging NC DNVs (n=249). In Chinese, NC and coding DNVs were predominantly associated with cardiomyocyte differentiation and with chamber/valve/aorta development, respectively, producing a combined enrichment in NOTCH signaling (P=1.1x10-6) and outflow tract morphogenesis (P=2.2x10-5). Genes with NC DNVs (e.g., EFNB2, HEY2 and PITX2) interacted with NOTCH1 and FLT4 in a tight STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. During the in vitro cardiac differentiation process, these noncoding candidate genes, which harbored potentially damaging regulatory NC DNVs, exhibited co-expression with NOTCH signaling genes and demonstrated dysregulated gene expression at various differentiation stages following NOTCH1 downregulation. In summary, our findings highlight a significant contribution of NC DNVs to TOF and suggest the presence of population genetic heterogeneity. Integrative analyses implicate dysregulation of NOTCH signaling, with converging influences from both coding and noncoding variants, in TOF within the Chinese population."
39921257,"High resolution crystal structure of stimulatory peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligands bound to TCR revealed different conformation of the two peptides at positions P6 and V7 compared to the conformation of the same peptides presented by unliganded MHC. Supercomputer simulation and well-tempered metadynamics approach revealed several meta-stable non-canonical TCR-pMHC interactions that depend on the conformation of the MHC-bound peptides. The diversity of meta-stable states was significantly more represented in signaling TCR-pMHC complex. These findings suggest that TCR-pMHC recognition can be informed by a conformation of peptide presented by MHC that notably influences the orientation of TCR recognizing pMHC ligand. It appears that TCR bound to stimulatory pMHC possess a significantly higher degree of freedom to assume various metastable TCR orientations which are distinct from canonical docking. In contrast, TCR interacting with non-stimulatory pMHC ligand revealed markedly less meta-stable non-canonical interactions and disengaged from the pMHC. This suggests that productive TCR-mediated signaling may depend on non-canonical interactions between TCR and pMHC, either facilitating early recognition events or providing new contacts for catch-bond formation. Our discovery can inform future attempts to simulate the catch-bond formation mechanism in TCR-pMHC recognition, allowing the formation of new bonds mediating alternative peptide presentation."
39921242,"Cervical cancer is one of the cancers commonly found in the female reproductive system and is associated with obesity. However, the exact connection mechanisms remain unclear. Screening of key therapeutic targets and natural products with good anti-tumor activity has become a crucial strategy for cancer therapy. Cryptotanshinone has anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties. Key therapeutic targets and related low-toxicity natural active ingredients were identified as crucial components in cancer treatment strategies. Therefore, network pharmacology and cellular biology techniques were used to screen and validate key targets in obesity-related cervical cancer and to elucidate the mechanisms. The results indicated that C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8) might be modulated by cryptotanshinone. The knockdown of CXCL8 significantly reduced Hela cell viability to 15.29 ± 4.59% compared with the control group (p<0.01), which consequently inhibited both cell proliferation and lipid droplet formation. Moreover, cryptotanshinone (20, 40, and 80 μM) significantly reduced CXCL8 expression and inhibited the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway in Hela cells compared with the control group (p<0.01). Therefore, this study manifested that cryptotanshinone potentially played an important role in obesity-related cervical cancer. This study provided the important experimental basis for further exploring the pathogenesis and prevention of obesity-related cervical cancer."
39921142,"Oral cancer is a malignant tumor, and the associated death rate has significantly increased over the past few decades. Secreted fractions are involved in various physiological processes, and their analysis has become a promising approach for discovering diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for cancer detection and monitoring metastasis. Therefore, the discovery of potential prognostic, diagnostic, and therapeutic biomarkers for oral cancer metastasis is beneficial for developing effective strategies in oral cancer therapy. In this study, we used secretomic analysis to identify the secreted proteins involved in oral cancer. One of the identified proteins, peptidylprolyl isomerase A (PPIA), was selected for further investigation. We used RNA interference to investigate the effect of PPIA secretion on invasion and migration of OC3-I5 cells. Our results showed that reducing the expression and secretion of PPIA significantly decreased invasion and migration of OC3-I5 cells. Next, we used recombinant PPIA to investigate its direct effect on OC3 cell metastasis. The results revealed that proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC3 cells were significantly increased by treatment with the recombinant PPIA. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed higher PPIA expression in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Concisely, PPIA activated the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways and enhanced cell proliferation and metastasis through CD147. In summary, PPIA may prove to be a novel target for oral cancer therapy as well as a prognostic marker."
39921114,"The initial microbial colonization of the gut is seeded by microbes transmitted from the mother's gut, skin, and vaginal tract. As the gut microbiome evolves, a few transmitted microbes persist throughout life. Understanding the impact of mother-to-neonate gut microbiome and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) transmission is crucial for establishing its role in infants' immunity against pathogens. This study primarily explores mother-neonate ARG transmission through 125 publicly available fecal metagenomes, isolated from eighteen mother-neonate pairs. The core ARGs, detected in both mothers and their respective infants at all stages (birth, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 8th and 12th months) included aminoglycosidases APH(3')-IIIa, Bifidobacterium adolescentis rpoB mutants conferring resistance to rifampicin, β-lactamases CblA-1, CfxA2, multi-drug resistance gene CRP, diaminopyrimidine resistance gene dfrF, fluoroquinolone-resistance gene emrR, macrolide; lincosamide; streptogramin resistance gene ErmB, ErmG, macrolide resistance gene Mef(En2), nucleosidase SAT-4, and tetracycline-resistance genes tet(O), tet(Q), and tet(W). Most of these infants and mothers were not administered any antibiotics. In infants, ARGs were predominantly carried by Bacillota, Pseudomonadota, and Actinomycetota, similar to the mothers. The dominant ARG-carrying opportunistic pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella, and Streptococcus, found across all infant cohorts. All the core ARGs were associated with mobile genetic elements, signifying the role of horizontal gene transfer(HGT). We detected 132 virulence determinants, mostly Escherichia coli-specific, including pilus chaperones, general secretion pathway proteins, type III secretion system effectors, and heme-binding proteins. Maternal-neonate transmission of ARGs along with possible nosocomial infections, mode of delivery, breastfeeding versus formula feeding, and gestation period, must be considered for mother-neonate health."
39921056,"In the present study, we investigated the potential use of five linear peptides as a potential antigens for the immunodiagnosis of tegumentary leishmaniasis (TL) and canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL). We used bioinformatics approaches to identify linear B-cell epitopes in five hypothetical proteins from a Leishmania (Leishmania) infantum proteome study. To obtain the peptide sequences of each hypothetical protein, we used the GenBank and SwissProt online databases. These peptides were synthesized and tested, alone or in a cocktail, in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) against serum samples from patients with TL and from dogs infected with CVL. Our data shows that for CVL diagnosis, the best results were found with peptides 1 and 5, which showed sensitivity values of 97.30% and 94.54%, and specificity values of 93.83% (pep 1) and 91.63% (pep 5), respectively. For TL, all peptides showed higher sensitivity and specificity when compared with SLALb, with the peptide cocktail obtaining a 99.10% accuracy. This study's outcome suggests that these peptides may constitute a potential tool for a more sensitive and specific serodiagnosis of TL and CVL."
39921049,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of widely expressed RNAs with covalently closed continuous structures. However, it is currently unknown if circRNAs shows allele-specific expression, as are the consequences of genetic variation on their circularization efficiency and subsequent biological function. Here, we propose a novel pipeline, ASE-circRNA, to accurately quantify both circRNA and their related linear RNA for each allele, and then assess the allele-specificity of the expression of a circular RNA. We identified and analyzed allele-specific circRNAs from human tissue, as well as brains from reciprocal crosses between pairs of highly divergent strains of both mice and pigs by next generation sequencing. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) was used to confirm the circularization efficiency measured by next generation sequencing. We found that variation in intron sequences affect the circularization efficiency of circRNAs. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a circRNA, circHK1, regulates the expression of POLR2A to influence the rate of cell proliferation. Our study provides new insight into the molecular mechanisms impacted by variation in genome sequence in the origin of human disease and phenotype."

39921821,"Over the past few years, the tumor microbiome is increasingly recognized for its multifaceted involvement in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. With the application of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA) sequencing, the intratumoral microbiome, also referred to as tumor-intrinsic or tumor-resident microbiome, has also been found to play a significant role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Understanding their complex functions is critical for identifying new therapeutic avenues and improving treatment outcomes. This review first summarizes the origins and composition of these microbial communities, emphasizing their adapted diversity across a diverse range of tumor types and stages. Moreover, we outline the general mechanisms by which specific microbes induce tumor initiation, including the activation of carcinogenic pathways, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, epigenetic modifications, and chronic inflammation. We further propose the tumor microbiome may evade immunity and promote angiogenesis to support tumor progression, while uncovering specific microbial influences on each step of the metastatic cascade, such as invasion, circulation, and seeding in secondary sites. Additionally, tumor microbiome is closely associated with drug resistance and influences therapeutic efficacy by modulating immune responses, drug metabolism, and apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, we explore innovative microbe-based therapeutic strategies, such as engineered bacteria, oncolytic virotherapy, and other modalities aimed at enhancing immunotherapeutic efficacy, paving the way for microbiome-centered cancer treatment frameworks."
39921808,"The Lewis spider mite (LSM), Eotetranychus lewisi, is an important pest of poinsettias (Euphorbia pulcherrima) and agricultural crops worldwide. In Europe it is a quarantine-regulated pest with established outdoor populations in Portugal. We investigated the pest status and host plants of the LSM in Madeira and the Algarve, collecting and inspecting plants and crops. The LSM was mainly found on naturalized poinsettias and castor-bean. Additionally, live mites were collected in very low numbers from plants of vine, cherimoya, mango, papaya, cherry plum, wild tobacco, and bladder vine, in direct contact or close to LSM-infested poinsettias, strongly suggesting these plants would not be breeding hosts. LSM abundance was low and no damage was observed. Mites were absent from strawberry, bramble and citrus, important hosts worldwide. Field surveys were complemented with a citizen-science experiment in outdoor conditions to test whether proximity to mite-infested poinsettias affected subsequent detections on poinsettia, strawberry, or grapevine. After two months of exposure to potentially dispersing LSM individuals and a further two months under controlled conditions to allow the mite to develop, LSM was detected on the three-recipient species but at low infestation rates, with a higher number of infested leaves and abundance on poinsettias, and absence of damages to crops. Overall, we conclude that the primary reservoirs for LSM populations in southwestern Europe are poinsettia and castor-bean plants, and our results suggest that the LSM is not causing damages to crops and may not be as harmful as expected, which can have implications to the current quarantine-regulation of this mite in Europe."
39921774,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the communication between the gut, liver, and brain through the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs serve as key mediators in the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis, influencing various physiological processes and contributing to overall health. SCFAs are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in the gut, and they exert systemic effects by signaling through various pathways. In the Gut-Liver axis, SCFAs regulate liver metabolism through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and other pathways, promotes fat oxidation, modulate inflammation through mTOR pathway, and impact metabolic health. In the Gut-Brain axis, SCFAs influence brain function, behavior, and may have implications for neurological disorders, in which G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an essential role, along with other pathways such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway. Understanding the mechanisms by which SCFAs mediate communication between the gut, liver, and brain is crucial for elucidating the complex interplay of the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis. This review aims to provide insight into the role of gut microbiota-derived SCFAs as mediators of the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis and their potential therapeutic implications. Further research in this area will be instrumental in developing novel strategies to target the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis for the prevention and treatment of various health conditions."
39921773,"Anorexia nervosa (AN) and depression are complex conditions with high comorbidity, impacting mental and physical health. Recent research suggests gut microbiota plays a significant role in their development and progression. This correspondence highlights the critical gaps in understanding the gut-brain axis in AN and depression, emphasizing the need for comprehensive research. We discuss recent findings, including altered gut microbiota profiles and inflammatory factors, and identify key areas for future investigation. These include large-scale, multi-center studies to quantify microbiota profiles, mechanistic understanding of gut microbiota alterations, and diagnostic and therapeutic advances using microbiota as biomarkers. Addressing these gaps is crucial for developing effective treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. By exploring the underlying mechanisms, validating biomarkers, and developing targeted therapies, we can enhance diagnostic accuracy, improve treatment outcomes, and better support patients with AN and depression. This research has the potential to transform the management of these conditions and improve quality of life for those affected.Level of evidence Low level of evidence as it is a personal opinion."
39921729,"Emerging research indicates that gut microbiota and the associated immune responses are crucial in the development of chronic inflammatory skin diseases. This investigation employs Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Bayesian weighting to elucidate the causal links between gut microbiota, immune cells, and psoriasis, with a specific emphasis on CD8 + T cells. We leveraged summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) related to gut microbiota, immune cells, and psoriasis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen as instrumental variables (IVs) to evaluate causal relationships through various MR methods, such as inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, and simple mode. Additionally, Bayesian weighting was used to validate results and account for potential pleiotropy. The IVW analysis revealed significant associations between certain gut microbiota and psoriasis, notably identifying a protective link between Escherichia coli and psoriasis. Further MR analysis demonstrated that Escherichia coli had a causal relationship with CD8 + T cells. Increased levels of CD8 + T cells were associated with a higher risk of psoriasis. BWMR analysis confirmed these findings, showing that CD8 + T cells mediated 10.09% of the protective effect of Escherichia coli on psoriasis. This study underscores the significant role of Escherichia coli and CD8 + T cells in psoriasis, suggesting both protective and exacerbating effects. Understanding these microbiota-immune interactions can lead to the development of more effective, personalized treatments and preventative strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life."
39921224,"Benthic bacterial communities are sensitive to habitat condition and present a fast response to environmental stressors, which makes them powerful ecological indicators of estuarine environments. The aim of this work is to study the spatial-temporal patterns of benthic bacterial communities in response to contrasting environmental conditions and assess their potential as ecological indicators of estuarine sediments. We characterized the diversity of bacterial communities in three contrasting sites on Sado Estuary (SW Coast, Portugal) and 4 sampling occasions, using 16S metagenomic approach. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that diversity patterns of bacterial communities will be distinct between sites and across sampling occasions. Bacterial communities were more influenced by each site conditions than by temporal variations in the sediments. The main drivers of bacterial distribution were sediments' composition, organic contents, and hydrodynamic activity. This work provided an important baseline dataset from Sado estuary to explore bacterial networks concerning benthic ecosystem functioning."
39920970,"To evaluate the potential differences in plankton diversity and stability within freshwater lake and reservoir ecosystems, this study employed eDNA metabarcoding to analyze the diversity, assembly mechanisms, stability, and environmental drivers of plankton communities in natural water (Y region) and artificial lake water (M region) at Liupanshui Minghu National Wetland Park, Guizhou Province, China. The study revealed notable regional variations in plankton diversity and assembly mechanisms. Specifically, Shannon, Simpson, and Pielou's evenness indices were higher in the M region, suggesting a more complex species composition compared to the Y region. Analysis of community assembly mechanisms indicated that both regions were influenced by a combination of stochastic and deterministic processes, with stochastic processes serving as the dominant driver. Through LEfSe analysis, Random Forest predictions, and molecular ecological network evaluations, certain OTUs identified as ""dual-characteristic"" species were consistently highlighted. These species may play a critical role in shaping community composition and contributing to stability. Environmental drivers further clarified these differences. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that TDS was the primary factor driving regional differences in key zooplankton species, while EC and DO were significant factors influencing the distribution of key phytoplankton species. Stability assessments, which combined molecular ecological network analysis and the coefficient of variation in species population density, revealed higher stability in the Y region. This indicates that the natural water system (Y region) has a greater resistance to disturbances compared to the artificial system in the M region. The findings provide fundamental support for assessing the health of aquatic ecosystems, as well as for the effective monitoring and biodiversity conservation of lake and reservoir ecosystems."
39920968,"Microplastics serve as favorable substrates for microbial colonization, promoting biofilm formation, which consequently facilitates the accumulation of pollutants and aids in the degradation of microplastics. Hence, obtaining a thorough comprehension of the factors that influence the development of microplastic biofilms is imperative. Nevertheless, there have been conflicting responses concerning biofilm formation in conjunction with microplastic characteristics and environmental conditions. As a result, a meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively evaluate the impact of microplastic properties and environmental factors on biofilm formation. The findings indicated that the type and size of microplastics significantly influence biofilm growth on their surfaces. Non-degradable microplastics, particularly polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS), exhibited higher surface biomass and biodiversity in microplastic-attached biofilms compared to degradable microplastics. Furthermore, it was observed that smaller microplastics were more conducive to microbial colonization. Model selection and correlation analysis further indicated that the environment acts as a substantial predictor of biofilm formation, with prolonged exposure significantly enhancing microbial diversity within biofilms as opposed to short-term exposure. Moreover, meta-regression analysis illustrated a positive correlation between biofilm biomass and alpha-diversity with temperature, while salinity exhibited a negative correlation in diverse aquatic settings. Notably, the ease of biofilm formation on microplastics was observed to be greater in oceans compared to lakes, yet biofilms exhibited a higher diversity increment in lakes than their oceanic counterparts. In the long-term growth of biofilms, initial biomass and diversity are influenced by microplastic characteristics and the surrounding environment, although environmental influences may assume more significance as time progresses."
39920932,"We developed a complex coacervation method of preparing Cinnamomum camphora essential oil (CEO) microcapsules using gelatin and gum arabic as wall materials. The microencapsulation process was optimized using Plackett-Burman and Box-Behnken designs with a maximum yield of 84.48 ± 3.15 % and encapsulation efficiency of 91.89 ± 2.71 %. The thermogravimetric analysis demonstrated that the microencapsulation process clearly enhanced the thermal stability of the CEO, and assessment of their controlled-release ability revealed that the release mechanism of the microcapsules resembled diffusion. The CEO microcapsules exhibited effective antifungal activity against Fusarium culmorum and Fusarium sporotrichioides, and the inhibitory effect was highly correlated with the fumigation concentration of the microcapsules. This study provides valuable information for utilizing microcapsule carriers to deliver CEO as well as improve its preservation stability, which will broaden the applications of the CEO in the agricultural and food preservation industries."
39920902,"Invasive species present significant management challenges worldwide due to their ability to rapidly adapt to novel environments. The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, a globally distributed invasive species, arrived in western Sweden in 2006 but has not yet colonised the low salinity waters of the Baltic Sea, presumably because low salinities act as a barrier to reproduction. We used classic mating designs to investigate fertilisation rates and heritability of embryonal salinity tolerance (in 8‰-33‰) in oysters from three locations with different invasion history and salinity (established, 33‰; past invasion front, 23.5‰; and present invasion front, 16‰). We found that fertilisation rates at lower salinities increased with proximity to the range front, with a pronounced heritable component. We then used whole-genome sequencing of oysters from the present invasion front to identify genomic regions showing stronger deviations from Mendelian inheritance in larval full-sib families reared in low salinity compared to controls. These regions contained coding sequences for Histones and ribosomal DNA, with the paternal genotype explaining a significant proportion of the deviation, suggesting the involvement of sperm in modulation of low-salinity tolerance at fertilisation and early development. Furthermore, we found no evidence of recent bottlenecks along the invasion front. We conclude that the Pacific oyster has developed low-salinity tolerant reproductive phenotypes at the present invasion front through acclimation and natural selection. Given the strong heritability for tolerance to low-salinities at fertilisation, the species likely has the potential to adapt further to low-salinity conditions and may invade the Baltic Sea."
39920864,"Neonatal mice are frequently used to model diseases that affect human infants. Microbial community composition has been shown to impact disease progression in these models. Despite this, the maturation of the early-life murine microbiome has not been well-characterized. We address this gap by characterizing the assembly of the bacterial microbiota of C57BL/6 and BALB/c litters from birth to adulthood across multiple independent litters."
39920808,"Wild edible plants (WEPs) are vital to enhance food security and generate income. Despite Ethiopia's vast area and cultural diversity, there remains a need for further investigation of WEPs. Therefore, this study aimed to document WEPs, and the indigenous knowledge associated with them in the Metema and Quara districts of north-western Ethiopia."
39920804,"Weaning-associated enteric diseases are a major concern in the swine industry. This study investigates the effects of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) on the jejunum of weanling piglets, a segment of bowel less studied in terms of microbiomic changes despite its primary involvement in major post-weaning enteric diseases, including postweaning diarrhea (PWD). Thirty-two 3-week-old piglets were divided equally into two groups: Control and FMT. The FMT group received fecal microbiota preparation from 3-month-old healthy pigs on the 1st and 3rd day after weaning. Half of each group was inoculated with an enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolate 10 days post-FMT. Piglets were euthanized in the third week (14th and 18th days post-FMT) after weaning to collect intestinal tissues and contents for microbiomic, metabolomic, and transcriptomic analyses."
39920791,"Despite the approval of several artificial nanotherapeutics for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), significant challenges, including unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes, severe side effects, and the high cost of large-scale production, still restrict their long-term application. In contrast, plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) exhibit promising potential in cancer therapy due to their negligible systemic toxicity, high bioavailability and cost- effectiveness. In this study, we developed an alternative strategy to inhibit TNBC via Platycodon grandiflorum (PG)-derived extracellular vesicles (PGEVs). The PGEVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and sucrose gradient centrifugation method and contained adequate functional components such as proteins, lipids, RNAs and active molecules. PGEVs exhibited remarkable stability, tolerating acidic digestion and undergoing minimal changes in simulated gastrointestinal fluid. They were efficiently taken up by tumor cells and induced increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to tumor cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis, particularly in the TNBC cell line 4T1. Additionally, PGEVs facilitated the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward M1 phenotype and increased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further in vivo investigations revealed that PGEVs efficiently accumulated in 4T1 tumors and exerted significant therapeutic effects through boosting systemic anti-tumor immune responses and modulating the gut microbiota whether administered orally or intravenously (i.v.). In conclusion, these findings highlight PGEVs as a promising natural, biocompatible and efficient nanotherapeutic candidate for treating TNBC."

39920776,"Altered gut microbiota has emerged as a major contributing factor to the etiology of chronic conditions in humans. Antibiotic exposure, historically dating back to the mass production of penicillin in the early 1940s, has been proposed as a primary contributor to the cumulative alteration of microbiota over generations. However, the mechanistic link between the antibiotics-altered microbiota and chronic conditions remains unclear."
39920770,"Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are instrumental in maintaining intestinal homeostasis and have emerged as potential therapeutic candidates for ameliorating intestinal bacterial infections. However, the intrinsic instability associated with the in vivo delivery of AMPs constitutes a substantial impediment to their therapeutic efficacy in treating infections. In this study, we genetically modified Bacillus subtilis (B. subtilis) WB600 to express Zophobas atratus defensin (ZD), an antimicrobial peptide with broad-spectrum activity isolated from Zophobas atratus, for oral administration. This engineered strain effectively protects against Salmonella Infantis (S. Infantis) infection in mice. Pretreatment with WB600/ZD prevented NF-κB pathway activation induced by S. Infantis infection and increased expression of antioxidant and tight junction proteins, thus alleviating the severity of intestinal inflammation in both the jejunum and ileum (P < 0.01). Moreover, WB600/ZD pretreatment facilitated the growth of beneficial bacteria such as Lachnospiraceae, Butyricicoccus, Eubacterium_xylanophilum, and Clostridia_UCG-014 while decreasing the abundance of pathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia-Shigella and Salmonella (P < 0.05). In conclusion, this study underscores the protective effects of WB600/ZD on S. Infantis-induced intestinal inflammation, suggesting that oral delivery of B. subtilis WB600/ZD may be a promising prophylactic strategy for combating bacterial infections in the intestine."
39920713,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the fastest-growing metabolic disease in the world. The gut microbiota is linked to T2DM.

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear."
39920535,"Non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors like tamoxifen citrate are commonly used in aquaculture for sex reversal, yet their broader impacts on fish growth, body composition, serum biochemistry, and gut histomorphology remain underexplored. This study evaluated the effects of tamoxifen citrate on hybrid red tilapia fry growth, reproductive traits, haematological parameters, biochemical profiles, and reproductive hormone levels.A total of 260 swim-up fry (mean weight 0.06 ± 0.04 g) were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: TA0 (0 mg/kg), TA1 (200 mg/kg), TA2 (400 mg/kg), and TA3 (600 mg/kg), with three replicates of 25 fish each. Fish were fed these diets for 60 days, followed by a 90-day recovery phase in outdoor hapas. The results showed that the male percentage increased significantly with tamoxifen inclusion, reaching 96.83% at 600 mg/kg (P < 0.05). Oestrogen levels decreased, while 11-ketotestosterone increased proportionally with tamoxifen dosage (P < 0.05). Higher tamoxifen inclusion (600 mg/kg) worsened feed conversion ratio (FCR), feed conversion efficiency (FCE), and protein efficiency ratio (PER) during the treatment phase but improved these parameters during recovery, alongside enhanced weight gain and specific growth rate (SGR) (P < 0.05). Higher tamoxifen doses increased hepatosomatic (HSI), viscerosomatic (VSI), and stomach indices while reducing gonadosomatic index (GSI) (P < 0.05). Elevated dosages reduced protein and lipid content but increased moisture levels (P < 0.05). Haemoglobin, MCV, MCH, and MCHC were higher at 200-400 mg tamoxifen/kg, while haematocrit declined with higher dosages (P < 0.05). Elevated tamoxifen levels increased AST, ALT, and globulin but decreased ALP, albumin, and cholesterol (P < 0.05). Moderate tamoxifen dosages (200-400 mg/kg) are recommended for sustainable sex reversal in hybrid red tilapia, minimising physiological and histological disruptions. High dosages (> 400 mg/kg) should be avoided due to haematological stress and immune suppression. Further studies are necessary to assess long-term ecological impacts and aquatic biodiversity."
39920351,"Horseshoe bats are natural hosts of zoonotic viruses, yet the genetic basis of their antiviral immunity is poorly understood. Here we generated two new chromosomal-level genome assemblies for horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus) and three close relatives, and show that, during their diversification, horseshoe bats underwent extensive chromosomal rearrangements and gene expansions linked to segmental duplications. These expansions have generated new adaptive variations in type I interferons and the interferon-stimulated gene ANXA2R, which potentially enhance antiviral states, as suggested by our functional assays. Genome-wide selection screens, including of candidate introgressed regions, uncover numerous putative molecular adaptations linked to immunity, including in viral receptors. By expanding taxon coverage to ten horseshoe bat species, we identify new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, and report convergent functionally important residues that could explain wider patterns of susceptibility across mammals. We conclude that horseshoe bats have numerous signatures of adaptation, including some potentially related to immune response to viruses, in genomic regions with diverse and multiscale mutational changes."
39921778,"The biodegradation of polyurethane foam (PU foam) using a combination of oxidative pre-treatment (ozonization) and Tenebrio molitor (T. molitor) mealworms was conducted in this study. Different degrees of ozone oxidation (0%, 25%, and 50%) were applied to PU foam, which was subsequently fed to mealworms. The mealworms' survival and growth were then compared to mealworms receiving a normal diet (bran). Results showed that mealworms fed with non-oxidized PU foam (PUF0) exhibited a higher consumption rate (11.8%) than those fed with 25% (PUF25) and 50% (PUF50) oxidized PU foam (7.7% and 5.7%, respectively). The survival rate was similar across all the PU foam diets and the bran diet. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses revealed minor structural changes in the PU foam. The gut microbiota analysis showed a significant correlation between the PU foam and bran diets. Among the different oxidized PU, distinct microbial community profiles were also observed, with the genus Klebsiella consistently present across the PU foam diets. The ozone pre-treatment altered the palatability and degradation of the PU foam by mealworms, while the mealworm frass and chitin obtained could potentially be used as resources for agricultural and industrial applications that would close the circular bio-economy cycle."
39919579,"Circular bio-based building materials (CBBMs) offer a sustainable solution for reducing the climate impact of buildings and are crucial for transitioning the construction industry towards a circular economy (CE). Reusing, cascading, and recycling municipal biowaste, agricultural by-products, and residues to produce CBBMs can optimise resource utilisation and deliver substantial environmental, economic, and social benefits, as well as promote a circular bioeconomy (CBE). Despite these benefits, the CBBM adoption in the Global South remains limited due to various barriers. Notably, the existing literature lacks research into the current use status and adoption barriers of CBBMs in these regions. This study addresses these gaps by investigating the usage and barriers to CBBM adoption, based on insights from building professionals in Vietnam. Data from 123 valid responses were analysed using descriptive statistics, ranking analysis, and exploratory factor analysis. The findings indicate that ""circular bio-based panels or particle boards"", ""agricultural by-products mixed with clay for wall construction"", and ""circular bio-based concrete, bricks, fillers, or binders"" are the most commonly utilised CBBMs. Government-related barriers, such as ""building code restrictions and lack of regulation"", ""lack of government promotion and incentives"", and ""lack of design guides and tools for projects using CBBMs"", are identified as the most significant obstacles to CBBM uptake. Kendall's W and Whitney U tests reveal a strong consensus among experts, with no significant differences between those with and without firsthand CBBM experience regarding their ranks of barriers. Exploratory factor analysis identified 20 independent barriers, grouped into four components, with the one containing cost and time-related barriers emerging as the most dominant to market and technical-related, government-related, and information and perception-related barriers. The study's findings could provide useful insights for policy recommendations to promote CBBM adoption in Vietnam. These insights may also inform strategies in other Global South countries with similar socioeconomic conditions to facilitate the transition to CE and CBE, mitigating climate change impact, and promoting sustainable development."
39916338,"Biofertilizers are considered as a sustainable solution for promoting the growth and productivity of crops while reducing the dependence on chemical fertilizers. There is a growing need for the sustainable agricultural solutions to lessen the reliance on chemical fertilizers; thus, evaluating Bacillus strains as biofertilizers for cotton growth promotion can support eco-friendly and economically viable crop production. Therefore, the growth promoting potential of endophytic Bacillus altitudinis strain TM22 and B. atrophaeus strain MCM61 applied as soil drenching or seed treatment, was evaluated on cotton cv. 'SS32'. In vitro, the qualitative assay both TM22 and MCM61 showed proteolytic, amylolytic, lipolytic, cellulolytic, and chitinolytic activity. TM22 and MCM61 strains also demonstrated the ability to produce siderophores, indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), and phosphate solubilization. In the pot experiment, seed biopriming with TM22 and MCM61 had better performance regarding plant growth and biomass, photosynthetic pigments, stomatal conductance, and relative leaf water contents than the soil drenching application. The gene expression analysis of growth hormones-related genes demonstrated that TM22 and MCM61 showed an upregulated expression of ARF1, ARF18, EXP6, IAA9, GIB1b, and CKX6 while ERF and ERF17 genes were downregulated. Overall, these findings suggest that seed biopriming with B. altitudinis TM22 and B. atrophaeus MCM61 is an effective method with the potential to enhance the biomass of cotton."
39914116,"High Production Volume Chemicals (HPVCs) are contaminants that pose serious threats to aquatic environments and species that inhabit them, given their massive production and ubiquitous distribution across biological compartments. Among them, organophosphate esters (OPEs) are of particular concern, as they are widely used as plasticizers and flame-retardants, and linked to various forms of toxicity in marine organisms. In this study, we investigated the ecotoxicological response of juvenile gilthead seabream Sparus aurata to the OPE tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP) following chronic dietary exposure to three different concentrations (low, D1: 0.2 mg kg-1; ecologically relevant, D2: 2 mg kg-1; and high, D3: 10 mg kg-1). Different biomarkers indicative of antioxidant defence mechanisms (catalase, CAT, glutathione S-transferase, GST, activities), metabolism (citrate synthase, CS, lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, activities) and endocrine disruption (vitellogenin content, VTG), as well as cell (lipid peroxidation levels, LPO) and protein damage (ubiquitin content, UBI) were analyzed in liver and muscle to assess TCPP toxicity. High concentrations of TCPP affected S. aurata growth, but not overall fitness condition. Furthermore, metabolic disruption and severe oxidative damages were observed, regardless of exposure dose. VTG content significantly decreased after exposure to all TCPP dosages, indicating a possible masculinization effect. These findings provide new insights to the scientific knowledge on TCPP ecotoxicological attributes and impacts on marine ichthyofauna. In addition, our results confirm the relevance of conducting integrated multi-biomarker approaches to disclose the ecotoxicological effects of poorly studied chemical contaminants and, ultimately, implement wastewater treatment strategies and legislation to protect marine ecosystems from pollution."
39910851,"There is a need for ground-breaking technologies to boost crop yield, both grains and biomass, and their processing into economically competitive materials. Novel cereals with enhanced photosynthesis and assimilation of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide and ozone, and tailored straw suitable for industrial manufacturing, open a new perspective for the circular economy. Here we describe the vision, strategies, and objectives of BEST-CROP, a Horizon-Europe and United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) funded project that relies on an alliance of academic plant scientists teaming up with plant breeding companies and straw processing companies to use the major advances in photosynthetic knowledge to improve barley biomass and to exploit the variability of barley straw quality and composition. We adopt the most promising strategies to improve the photosynthetic properties and ozone assimilation capacity of barley: (i) tuning leaf chlorophyll content and modifying canopy architecture; (ii) increasing the kinetics of photosynthetic responses to changes in irradiance; (iii) introducing photorespiration bypasses; (iv) modulating stomatal opening, thus increasing the rate of carbon dioxide fixation and ozone assimilation. We expect that by improving our targeted traits we will achieve increases in aboveground total biomass production without modification of the harvest index, with added benefits in sustainability via better resource-use efficiency of water and nitrogen. In parallel, the resulting barley straw is tailored to: (i) increase straw protein content to make it suitable for the development of alternative biolubricants and feed sources; (ii) control cellulose/lignin contents and lignin properties to develop straw-based construction panels and polymer composites. Overall, by exploiting natural- and induced-genetic variability as well as gene editing and transgenic engineering, BEST-CROP will lead to multi-purpose next generation barley cultivars supporting sustainable agriculture and capable of straw-based applications."
39910383,"Over the past billion years, the fungal kingdom has diversified to more than two million species, with over 95% still undescribed. Beyond the well-known macroscopic mushrooms and microscopic yeast, fungi are heterotrophs that feed on almost any organic carbon, recycling nutrients through the decay of dead plants and animals and sequestering carbon into Earth's ecosystems. Human-directed applications of fungi extend from leavened bread, alcoholic beverages and biofuels to pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and psychoactive compounds. Conversely, fungal infections pose risks to ecosystems ranging from crops to wildlife to humans; these risks are driven, in part, by human and animal movement, and might be accelerating with climate change. Genomic surveys are expanding our knowledge of the true biodiversity of the fungal kingdom, and genome-editing tools make it possible to imagine harnessing these organisms to fuel the bioeconomy. Here, we examine the fungal threats facing civilization and investigate opportunities to use fungi to combat these threats."
39910223,"In this study, the physicochemical properties (electrical conductivity (EC), pH, free acidity, moisture content, DPPH radical scavenging activity, total polyphenols content (TPC), flavonoids content (FC), individual polyphenols, carbohydrates, and organic acids), microbiological quality, and antibacterial activity of honey (raspberry, rosehip, alfalfa, hawthorn, and honeydew honey) from Bucovina were evaluated. Along with melissopalynological analysis, the physicochemical parameters were determined for the honey samples to characterize the samples and to assess their applicability in classifying honey based on its botanical origin. Another objective of the study was the evaluation of the microbiological quality and antibacterial activity of honey samples. The antibacterial activity was examined against the growth of four pathogenic bacterial strains (Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028) by the diffusion test in the agar well and by determining the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and the minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The analyzed honey samples were within the safe limits, except for three samples in which Bacillus cereus was detected and two other samples that had values above the acceptable limit for yeasts. Thus, 40.46% of all honey samples had bactericidal activity that was superior or at least comparable to manuka honey MGO550 against Staphylococcus aureus, 57.69% against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, 74.15% against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 75% against Escherichia coli. Of all types of honey analyzed in this study, honeydew honey had the highest bactericidal activity, followed by polyfloral honey."
39908951,"Climate change is increasing marine heatwaves (MHWs) frequency and severity worldwide. These extreme events often cause bivalves' mass mortality and facilitate the growth, proliferation and dispersion of toxin-producing microalgae blooms associated with threats to seafood safety. Yet, the interactive effects between MHW and uptake of marine biotoxins by biota are a novel topic still lacking thorough research, from both the ecotoxicological and seafood safety standpoints. This study assessed the effects of a MHW event on the accumulation/elimination dynamics of diarrhetic shellfish toxins in Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to Prorocentrum lima and the ecotoxicological responses of mussels co-exposed to these two stressors. Results showed that acute exposure to +4 °C reduced toxins accumulation (-49 %) and elimination (-77 %) compared to control temperature. Moreover, exposure to MHW and toxins affected mussels' antioxidant activity, lipid and protein damage, and metabolism in a tissue-specific manner. These findings highlight that M. galloprovincialis can face higher vulnerability to toxins when MHW events strike."
39908902,"Scenario analysis plays a central role in estimating how global changes affect the relationships linking ecosystem conditions and functioning to human needs. This is particularly true for agroecosystems, which are pivotal to ensure sustainable land planning, ecological management and food security strategies. Soils are key providers of multiple ecosystem services (ES) in agroecosystems but they are very sensitive to global drivers such as changes in climate, land use and cover. How agroecosystems should achieve sustainability, through optimizing soil capacity to supply ES while limiting the occurrence of threats, is a priority of EU policy agendas. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive framework of scenario-based approaches to assess changes in soil ES (SES) and soil threats (ST). As a part of the project SERENA funded by the European Joint Program on Agricultural Soil Management, this study aims to: i) understand how drivers of global change are commonly studied in the scientific literature; ii) identify how some SES and ST are assessed in scenario-based approaches; iii) provide a preliminary discussion on how soil properties are represented in these approaches. Through a systematic review of 230 published articles related to seven SES and ten ST, this study highlights that not all SES and ST are considered with the same frequency and geographic distribution in scenario-based approaches. Despite a great methodological variability in the assessment and mapping of SES and ST, dominant methodological trends can be identified. SES are mapped more frequently than ST and, specific SES appear more disposed to spatially explicit assessments than others. Due to its novelty and complexity, research on this topic is limited to a small subset of ST or SES and projections of the combined impacts of climate, land use and management changes on multiple ST and SES should be a scientific priority to help policy makers."
39907816,"Conduct a cross-sectional study to investigate the periodontal conditions and oral health behaviours among adult subjects with type one diabetes mellitus and compare them with those of a group of age- and gender-matched without diabetes. Furthermore, we also intend to evaluate the potential indicators of the risk for the development of periodontal disease."
39906168,"Despite the transformative power of gene editing for crop improvement, its widespread application across species and varieties is limited by the transformation bottleneck that exists for many crops. The genetic transformation of plants is hindered by a general reliance on in vitro regeneration through plant tissue culture. Tissue culture requires empirically determined conditions and aseptic techniques, and cannot easily be translated to recalcitrant species and genotypes. Both Agrobacterium-mediated and alternative transformation protocols are limited by a dependency on in vitro regeneration, which also limits their use by non-experts and hinders research into non-model species such as those of possible novel biopharmaceutical or nutraceutical use, as well as novel ornamental varieties. Hence, there is significant interest in developing tissue culture-independent plant transformation and gene editing approaches that can circumvent the bottlenecks associated with in vitro plant regeneration recalcitrance. Compared to tissue culture-based transformations, tissue culture-independent approaches offer advantages such as avoidance of somaclonal variation effects, with more streamlined and expeditious methodological processes. The ease of use, dependability, and accessibility of tissue culture-independent procedures can make them attractive to non-experts, outperforming classic tissue culture-dependent systems. This review explores the diversity of tissue culture-independent transformation approaches and compares them to traditional tissue culture-dependent transformation strategies. We highlight their simplicity and provide examples of recent successful transformations accomplished using these systems. Our review also addresses current limitations and explores future perspectives, highlighting the significance of these techniques for advancing plant research and crop improvement."
39904432,"Nanocellulose, a promising green material derived from various bio-sources, has potentiality on and off-site in the agricultural sector. Due to its special qualities, which include high strength, hydrophilicity, and biocompatibility, it is a material that may be used in a variety of industries, especially agriculture. This review explores in this article production processes, post-processing procedures, and uses of nanocellulose in soil fertility increment and sustainable agriculture. A variety of plant materials, agricultural waste, and even microbes can be used to isolate nanocellulose. Nanocellulose is produced using both top-down and bottom-up methods, each of which has benefits and limitations of its own. It can be applied as nano-biofertilizer in agriculture to enhance beneficial microbial activity, increase nutrient availability, and improve soil health. Moreover, nanocellulose can be used in fertilizer and pesticide formulations with controlled releases to increase efficacy and lessen environmental effects. Innovative approaches to sustainable agriculture are provided by nanocellulose technologies, which also support the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially those pertaining to eradicating hunger and encouraging responsible consumption. Nanocellulose promotes climate action and ecosystem preservation by increasing resource efficiency and decreasing dependency on hazardous chemicals, ultimately leading to the development of a circular bioeconomy. Nonetheless, there are still issues with the high cost of production and the energy-intensive isolation procedures. Despite its various potentialities, challenges such as high production costs, environmental concerns, and regulatory issues must be addressed for nanocellulose to be widely adopted and effectively integrated into farming practices."
39900224,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections, especially methicillin resistant (MRSA), constitute an alarming public health issue due to its association with high mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization costs. The increasing antibiotic resistance and biofilm-associated infections of MRSA prompted the discovery of novel and more effective therapeutic strategies. Our team has been working on alternative therapies against S. aureus infections. For this, we have been repurposing an existing antibacterial drug, rifabutin (RFB), through its association to a nanotechnological platform, liposomes, aiming to promote a preferential targeting to infected sites and maximizing its potential antibacterial effect. The therapeutic potential of RFB formulations against a MRSA commercial strain (MRSA ATCC®-33592), either in planktonic or biofilm forms, was assessed. RFB displayed higher antibacterial effects towards biofilm than vancomycin (VCM), the gold standard treatment against MRSA infections, with MBIC50 values of 103 and > 800 μg/ml, respectively. Moreover, the antimicrobial effect of RFB-loaded liposomes demonstrated to be lipid composition-dependent based on MIC50 and MBIC50 values, which was also confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. These studies supported that for positively charged RFB liposomes an electrostatic interaction at biofilm surface occurs without internalization. On the other hand, for RFB-loaded liposomes with neutral surface charge a high internalization within the biofilm was observed. Moreover, this RFB liposomal formulation has also demonstrated to be stable in human plasma, as more than 83 % of RFB was still associated to liposomes 24 h after incubation at 37 °C. The proof of concept of RFB formulations was assessed in MRSA systemic murine models of infection. Therapeutic effect and survival rates were evaluated for animals induced and treated with RFB in free and liposomal forms and compared with negative and positive controls. For the lower infection murine model, 100 % survival was achieved for all groups under study. However, in a higher infection model only for the group of animals treated with RFB incorporated in liposomes a 100 % survival was attained. In terms of bacterial burden, RFB formulations exhibited lower levels when compared to VCM, even using a lower therapeutic dose: 20 vs 40 mg/kg of body weight, respectively. Overall, RFB constitutes an alternative and effective therapeutic strategy towards MRSA infections, being this effect potentiated through its association to a lipid nanoplatform."
39899506,"Cultivated raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.) most commonly bear small, red, highly aromatic fruits. Their colour is derived predominantly from anthocyanins, water soluble polyphenolic pigments, but as well as red forms, there exist cultivars that display yellow- and apricot-coloured fruits. In this investigation, we used a multi-omics approach to elucidate the genetic basis of the apricot fruit colour in raspberry. Using metabolomics, we quantified anthocyanins in red and apricot raspberry fruits and demonstrated that, in contrast to red-fruited raspberries, fruits of the apricot cultivar 'Varnes' contain low concentrations of only a small number of anthocyanin compounds. By performing RNASeq, we revealed differential expression patterns in the apricot-fruited 'Varnes' for genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway and following whole genome sequencing using long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing, we identified a CACTA-like transposable element (TE) in the second exon of the Anthocyanidin synthase (Ans) gene that caused a truncated predicted ANS protein. PCR confirmed the presence in heterozygous form of the transposon in an unrelated, red-fruited cultivar 'Veten', indicating apricot fruit colour is recessive to red and that it may be widespread in raspberry germplasm, potentially explaining why apricot forms appear at regular intervals in modern raspberry breeding populations."
39896271,"Agrotis ipsilon (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a significant pest in Oregon grass seed and vegetable production systems. Effective management of this species relies on timely foliar insecticide applications targeting immature A. ipsilon larvae before crop damage is observed. Regionally specific phenological models serve as a critical component of effective areawide pest management plans to inform the timing of pest monitoring and management action. Seasonal modeling of A. ipsilon phenology is complicated by their migratory behavior and limited knowledge of temperature-dependent development on affected crop hosts. Growth chamber experiments at five constant temperatures (12 to 32°C) were conducted to determine the temperature-dependent development of A. ispsilon life stages on an artificial and perennial ryegrass diet. The completion of one A. ipsilon generation (egg-to-adult) required 658.71 ± 31.49, 601.98 ± 16.01, 648.47 ± 21.35 degree days with a base temperature threshold of 9.8°C for artificial diet, perennial ryegrass diet, and across both diet types, respectively. The timing of migrant adults was predicted with surface air temperature using non-linear regression with A. ipsilon abundance data collected from pheromone-baited traps in 77 total commercial grass seed (n = 57) and vegetable (n = 20) production fields across 19 sampling years (1996 to 2023). Developmental parameters and predictions of adult arrival were used to develop general and grass seed specific phenology model projections for A. ipsilon populations in Oregon. Regionally validated phenology models can be incorporated into decision support tools to forecast the spatiotemporal occurrence of crop-damaging life stages of priority insect pests."
39895949,"The growing incidence of chronic diseases such as cancer and the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms constitute one of the greatest health challenges of the 21st century. Therefore, it is critical to search for new therapeutic alternatives. Moringa oleifera is a plant well known for the properties of its phytocomponents and its role has been analyzed in a variety of fields, from medicine to biotechnology."
39895663,"The evaluation of fruit genetic resources regarding a resistance to pathogens is an essential basis for subsequent selection in fruit breeding. Both genetic analysis and phenotyping of defined traits are important tools and provide decision data in the evaluation process. However, the phenotyping of plants is often carried out 'by hand' and remains the bottleneck in fruit breeding and fruit growing. The development of a digital and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)-based phenotyping method for the assessment of genotype-specific susceptibility or resistance against diseases in orchards would significantly increase the efficiency of plant breeding. In this framework, a workflow for drone-based monitoring of pathogens in orchards was developed using the European pear rust (Gymnosporangium sabinae) as model pathogen. Pear rust is widespread in orchards and causes conspicuous, clearly visible, yellow to orange-colored disease symptoms. In this paper, we provide a dataset with expert-annotated high-resolution RGB images with pear rust symptoms. For data collection, ten UAV-flight campaigns were realized between 2021 and 2023 under various weather conditions and with different flight parameters in the experimental orchard of the Julius Kühn-Institute for Breeding Research on Fruit Crops in Dresden-Pillnitz (Germany). 1394 images were captured of different pear genotypes, including varieties, wild species and progeny from breeding. The dataset contains manually labelled images with a size of 768 × 768 pixels of leaves infected with pear rust at different stages of development, labelled as class GYMNSA, as well as background images without symptoms. Each leaf with pear rust symptoms was annotated with the drawing method by two points (bounding boxes) using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT, v1.1.0) [1] and presented in YOLO 1.1 file format (.txt files). A total of 584 annotated images and 162 background images, organized into a training and validation set, are included in the GYMNSA dataset. This GYMNSA dataset can be used as a resource for researchers and developers working on drone-based plant disease monitoring systems."
39895265,"The intestinal epithelium plays a pivotal role as a vital barrier between the external environment and the human body, regulating nutrient absorption and preventing the entry of harmful substances. The human oral exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNP) raises concerns about their potential toxicity, especially at the intestinal level. The objective of this work was to investigate the potential pro-inflammatory effects of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-AgNP of two different sizes, 5 and 50 nm, at the intestinal level, while also assessing the protective ability of quercetin against these effects. To address this, an intestinal co-culture model comprising C2BBe1 cells and THP-1 derived macrophages was established, and the effects of 5 or 50 nm PVP-AgNP were studied, alone or in combination with quercetin, over two-time points, 4 and 24 hours. PVP-AgNP, of both sizes, disrupted the barrier integrity within 4 hours of exposure. However, a notable intensification in pro-inflammatory effects was evident only after 24 hours of exposure, especially with smaller PVP-AgNP (5 nm). This resulted in heightened cellular death, increased levels of reactive species, activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB), and production of interleukin (IL)-8. Quercetin demonstrates the ability to maintain barrier integrity and mitigate oxidative stress, thereby offering protection against the detrimental effects induced by AgNP at the intestinal level."

39893216,"Effect of modifying a vegetable grease with different amounts of chokeberry biocarbon on its tribological and rheological properties. The aim of the research was to investigate the effect of the incorporation of biochar derived from the pyrolysis of chokeberry biomass at 500 and 700 °C respectively, in lubricants formulated with vegetable oil, on their functional characteristics in terms of tribology and rheology. Fumed silicon dioxide was utilized as a thickening agent, ensuring the production of lubricants with a consistency class of II. The biochar was introduced into the lubricating formulations in concentrations of 1, 3, and 5%. A rapeseed-based grease with commercial activated carbon served as the reference sample. The research focused on assessing how this innovative additive influenced both the tribological and rheological behaviors of the resulting lubricants. The study evaluated the effects of chokeberry-derived biochar on the wear resistance and scuffing prevention properties of the vegetable-based greases. Additionally, the biochar's influence on various rheological parameters such as flow curves, viscosity profiles, hysteresis loops, and viscoelastic characteristics was analyzed. Results demonstrated that the biochar additive considerably enhanced the tribological and rheological performance of the tested rapeseed-based grease."
39921846,"Identifying metabolites produced by probiotic bacteria, also known as metabiotics, is becoming increasingly common due to their anti-inflammatory, anti-obesogenic, and immunomodulatory effects. Postbiotics alongside diet, regulate both physical and mental health, as the microbiota members can interact physically with host cells or through secretion of nutrients and metabiotics. These metabiotics also reduce the severity of certain metabolic disorders and support the proper functioning of various organs and systems. In this review, we describe the mechanisms of action of trans-vaccenic acid (TVA), indole-3-lactic acid (ILA), thiamine (vitamin B1), and butyric acid metabolites produced or induced by probiotics such as Lactobacillus and/or Bifidobacterium, among others and previously identified using analytical techniques such as mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Within their mechanisms of action, Trans-vaccenic acid exerts anti-inflammatory effects and helps alleviate complications associated with metabolic diseases. Indole metabolites promote IL-22 production and regulate epithelial cell proliferation and antimicrobial peptide production. Thiamin is essential for energy metabolism regulation, and butyric acid regulates the brain-gut axis and also regulates immune response. This review expands our understanding of the potential therapeutic use of metabiotics."
39921754,"Osteoarticular infections (OAI) are serious clinical conditions with Staphylococcus aureus and Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CoNS) responsible for up to two-thirds of cases.

39921728,"The LasR quorum sensing system regulates the virulence factors of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a multi-drug resistant pathogen. Mangiferin and related compounds have been found to modulate this system as determined by in silico and in vitro experimental procedures. ZINCPharmer was used to compile a library of over 1000 metabolites that were screened to the top five based on shared pharmacophores and drug-like properties with mangiferin. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation (140 ns) showed that ZINC E (- 55.64 ± 2.93 kcal/mol) and ZINC D (- 54.51 ± 2.82 kcal/mol) had significantly lower binding free energy compared to mangiferin-LasR (- 42.24 ± 3.94 kcal/mol) and the reference standard (azithromycin-LasR (- 40.01 ± 6.15 kcal/mol). ZINC D (95.16%) competed favorably with mangiferin (95.77%) as potential QS modulators at sub-minimum inhibitory concentrations relative to ZINC E (85.07%) and azithromycin (85.79%). These observations suggest mangiferin and related lead compounds as potential drug candidates for P. aeruginosa infection management."
39921723,"The use of a ketogenic diet (KD) in glioma is currently tested as an adjuvant treatment in standard chemotherapy regimens. The metabolic shift induced by the KD leads to the generation of ketone bodies that can influence glioma cells and the surrounding microenvironment, but the mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the potential involvement of glial cells as mediators of the KD-induced effects on tumor growth and survival rate in glioma-bearing mice. Specifically, we describe that exposing glioma-bearing mice to a KD or to β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), one of the main KD metabolic products, reduced glioma growth in vivo, induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in astrocytes and increased functional glutamate transporters. Moreover, we described increased intracellular basal Ca2+ levels in GL261 glioma cells treated with β-HB or co-cultured with astrocytes. These data suggest that pro-inflammatory astrocytes triggered by β-HB can be beneficial in counteracting glioma proliferation and neuronal excitotoxicity, thus protecting brain parenchyma."
39921711,"This review discusses the DNA and RNA methylation pathways and their biological roles in Rosaceae developmental processes relevant for breeding and production. The Rosaceae is a plant family of great importance for human nutrition and health. Many traits and developmental processes of the Rosaceae are influenced by epigenetic methylation, functions of which are now being unravelled in several important species of this family. Methylation of DNA at the 5th position of cytosine (5mC) is a well-established epigenetic mark that affects important cellular processes such as gene expression and genome stability and is involved in a wide range of plant biological functions. Further to this, recent technological advances have uncovered other naturally occurring chemical modifications of DNA and RNA as additional layers of regulatory epigenetic information in plants. In this review we give a comprehensive summary of plant 5-methylcytosine DNA methylation mechanisms and review their components identified in species of the Rosaceae family. We detail and discuss the role of 5mC DNA methylation dynamics in Rosaceae developmental processes, including phase transition, bud development, bud dormancy, plant architecture, plant regeneration, fruit development, ripening and senescence. We then review recent advances in understanding the newly identified nucleic acid modifications, N6-adenosine methylation of DNA (6mA) and RNA (m6A) as additional epigenetic mechanisms. We summarise identified components of adenosine methylation pathways in the Rosaceae and discuss the emerging roles of this modification in plant development including recent findings in Rosaceous species. Integrating epigenetic aspects of plant development with plant genetics and physiology is crucial for understanding biological processes in Rosaceous plants."
39921709,"Hyperpigmentation is a commonly occurring skin problem, it affects people's quality of life by causing anxiety and depression in them. This systematic review aims to critically evaluate the evidence of the effectiveness of formulations utilized in clinical trials for treating hyperpigmentation (melasma and photoaging). A comprehensive search was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, Google Scholar, and National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) databases, encompassing literature available up to December 2023. Clinical trials employing various formulations to address skin hyperpigmentation effectively were included and subsequently analysed. Meta-analysis was conducted using IBM SPSS Statistics software (version 29.0.1.0 for window) guidelines. From 102 literatures, 07 clinical studies that follow the inclusion criteria were selected. A total of 337 participants underwent a clinical trial, where 198 participants received the drug and 153 received a placebo. Meta-analysis of 07 clinical studies indicated that employed formulations have a significant effect on treating skin hyperpigmentation {Odds Ratio (OR): 4.260, 95% Confidence Interval (CI) 2.244 to 8.087, Probability value (P) p < 0.001} than placebo. Across 07 clinical trials, heterogeneity was found to be low {Tau-Squared (µ2) = 0.46, Degree of Freedom (df) = 6, p = 0.001, i-Squared (I2) = 0.76}. Formulations assessed in the meta-analysis are Ziziphus jujuba (Z. jujuba) syrup, Amorphophallus konjac (A. konjac) capsules, herbal mixture cream, cysteamine cream, 4-hexyl-1,3-phenylenediol lotion, lignin peroxidase cream, and 0.1% tretinoin cream. 0.1% tretinoin cream shows the lowest effect size while A. konjac capsules show the highest effect size among all the included studies. Formulations used in clinical trials have proven to be effective and safe for controlling skin hyperpigmentation compared to placebo treatments. Among all the formulations, 0.1% tretinoin demonstrates lower efficacy, while A. konjac exhibits the highest efficacy in treating hyperpigmentation. This systematic review will guide researchers and dermatologists in selecting quality products from the available formulations."
39921679,"Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are small cysteine-rich soluble proteins that affect flower and seed development, cuticular wax deposition, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. We isolated an LTP-encoding gene homologous to LTPVAS in Nicotiana benthamiana and designated it LTP-VASCULAR TISSUE SIZE (NbLTPVAS). This gene was expressed in seeds, leaves, roots, and stems. Additionally, NbLTPVAS expression was induced by hypersensitive response (HR)-inducing agents. Cell death was accelerated and the phytopathogenic bacterial population decreased significantly in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants infected with the incompatible Ralstonia solanacearum strain 8107. The expression of HR marker gene hin1 in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants was markedly induced by R. solanacearum 8107, indicative of the acceleration of HR. HR cell death in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants was also promoted by the Agrobacterium-mediated expression of HR-inducing proteins including INF1, AvrA, and PopP1. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants. The expression of NbrbohB (encoding a ROS-generating enzyme) also increased in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants, but the expression of the antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes NbSOD and NbAPX decreased. The silencing of both NbLTPVAS and NbrbohB adversely affected HR induction. Moreover, NbLTPVAS was secreted into the intercellular washing fluid. The transient expression of the full-length NbLTPVAS induced the expression of antioxidant genes, attenuated ROS production, and suppressed the induction of HR cell death. This is the first functional analysis of LTPVAS in plant-microbe interactions. Our study provides novel insights into the role of NbLTPVAS as a negative regulator of HR via ROS homeostasis in N. benthamiana."
39921597,"Osteoporosis is divided into primary and secondary types. Primary osteoporosis may result from estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women, imbalanced bone remodeling in the elderly, or imbalanced adolescent-type bone development. Secondary osteoporosis can be caused by factors like long-term glucocorticoid treatment, chronic kidney disease (CKD), estrogen deprivation, oxidative stress, diabetes, and obesity. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of soy isoflavones for osteoporosis. At the cellular level, soy isoflavones, as natural plant extracts and phytoestrogens, are crucial for osteoblastogenesis and differentiation, osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast mineralization, and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation. They also maintain calcium homeostasis by regulating extracellular calcium and vitamin D levels. In terms of oxidative stress, soy isoflavones mitigate it in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, thus regulating cellular senescence, autophagy, and bone remodeling processes. Moreover, soy isoflavones can relieve symptoms related to CKD and inhibit glucocorticoid secretion, which directly or indirectly benefits the treatment of osteoporosis. Overall, soy isoflavones have the potential to treat osteoporosis by enhancing bone health, regulating metabolism, and alleviating oxidative stress. Future research should explore the potential of soy isoflavones as phytoestrogens for treating osteoporosis. This exploration should focus on clarifying the safety, identifying potential side effects, determining the optimal dosage regimen, and developing strategies to mitigate any adverse reactions. In addition, further large-scale, multicenter human clinical trials are necessary to accurately evaluate the actual therapeutic effect of soy isoflavones on osteoporosis."
39921560,"Methylmercury (MeHg) is markedly toxic to humans. Our study explores whether MeHg and high-fat diet (HFD) can impair the intestinal barrier with microbiota dysbiosis in mice. Weanling mice were fed to HFD or standard diet for 40 days. In the last 20 days of diets, mice received either MeHg (20 mg/L) or drinking water. Proximal small intestine, cecum, and hair samples were collected. Villus length, crypt depth, villus/crypt length, mucin2 and lysozyme-positive cell counts, ZO-1 and occludin gene expression, and intestinal functional permeability were analyzed to assess the intestinal barrier. Blood samples were drawn to assess lipid parameters. Gut microbiome profiling was conducted with DNA from fecal/cecal samples. In addition, we analyzed ZO-1 immunofluorescence in the colon and small intestine. HFD increased MDA, Mucin2, and reduced villus height, crypt depth, villus/crypt length, lysozyme(+)-cell count, and increased intestinal permeability, regardless of MeHg intoxication. MeHg-HFD combination affected the intestinal barrier, decreasing ZO-1, occludin, and Nrf2 transcription, and increased permeability. HFD increased total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. Only MeHg-HFD reduced microbiome alpha-diversity along with colonic ZO-1 immunolabeling loss compared to non-intoxicated mice fed a control diet. Regardless of diet, the genera Streptococcus, Psychrobacter, Facklamia, and Corynebacterium were severely depleted following MeHg intoxication. Other groups, such as Atopostipes and Jeotgalicoccus, were not altered by MeHg or HFD alone, but were significantly reduced by the combined HFD-MeHg. Synergistic effects of MeHg-HFD on the mucosa-associated microbiota are more pronounced than their individual effects. Our findings suggest that MeHg intoxication does not cause extensive dysbiosis but led to intestinal barrier disruption."
39921464,"Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP-10) is crucial for endothelial cell signaling via activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), a pathway central to vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis. Dysregulated BMP-10 signaling contributes to cardiovascular diseases and cancer, highlighting the need to control ALK1-mediated endothelial responses to BMP-10 for therapeutic development. BMP-10 biosynthesis involves processing by proprotein convertases (PPCs) resulting in a non-covalently associated prodomain-growth factor (PD-GF) complex (CPLX), similar to other TGF-β superfamily ligands. However, the molecular requirements for BMP-10 bioactivity remain unclear. We investigated how PPC processing impacts BMP-10 structure, bioactivity, and its interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibrillin-1. Molecular dynamics simulations post-in silico cleavage of the BMP-10 dimer model as well as negative staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that PD processing increases BMP-10 flexibility converting it from a latent wide-angle conformation to a bioactive CPLX which can adopt a V-shape with tighter angle. Only processed BMP-10 demonstrated high potency in HUVEC and C2C12 cells and robust binding to immobilized BMP receptors. Circular dichroism and interaction studies revealed that the N-terminal region of the BMP-10 PD is rich in alpha-helical content, which is essential for efficient complexation with the BMP-10 GF. Binding studies and TEM analyses showed that only the processed BMP-10 CPLX interacts with the N-terminal region of fibrillin-1, causing a conformational change that renders it into a closed ring-shaped conformation. These findings suggest that PD processing induces specific folding events at the PD-GF interface, which is critical for BMP-10 bioactivity and its targeting to the ECM."
39921449,"ARMC5 is the most prevalent gene predisposing to Primary Bilateral Macronodular Adrenal Hyperplasia (PBMAH), but germline KDM1A variants have been identified in the rare PBMAH associated with food-dependent Cushing's syndrome (FDCS). The purpose of this work was to assess the frequency of KDM1A variants in a large series of PBMAH patients."
39921422,"Metasurfaces are the 2D counterparts of metamaterials, and their development is accelerating rapidly in the past years. This progress enables the creation of devices capable of uniquely manipulating light, with applications ranging from optical communications to remote biosensing. Metasurfaces are engineered by rational assembly of subwavelength elements, defined as meta-atoms, giving rise to unique physical properties arising from the collective behavior of meta-atoms. These meta-atoms are typically organized using effective, reproducible, and precise nanofabrication methods that require a lot of effort to achieve scalable and cost-effective metasurfaces. In contrast, bottom-up methods based on colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) have developed in the last decade as a fascinating alternative for accelerating the technological spread of metasurfaces. The present review takes stock of recent advances in the fabrication and applications of hybrid metasurfaces prepared by bottom-up methods, resulting in disordered metasurfaces. In particular, metasurfaces prepared with plasmonic NPs are emphasized for their multifold applications, which are discussed from a biotechnology perspective. However, some examples of organized metasurfaces prepared by merging bottom-up and top-down approaches are also described. Finally, leveraging the historical disordered metasurface evolution, the review draws new perspectives for random metasurface design and applications."
39921411,"Malaria vaccines are crucial for advancing public health and achieving malaria elimination. Currently, pre-erythrocytic vaccines like RTS, S/AS01 and R21/Matrix-M are in use, but their effectiveness is limited. Ongoing research on blood-stage vaccine candidates such as RH5, MSP1 and MSP3 has shown promising results. Incorporating a blood-stage vaccine could greatly enhance malaria control by targeting the symptomatic phase of the infection, providing additional protection alongside pre-erythrocytic vaccines and other control methods. Understanding the structural biology and immunological interactions of blood-stage antigens is essential for developing effective vaccines. Combining pre-erythrocytic and erythrocytic-stage vaccines could lead to better protection, improved public health outcomes and significant progress toward malaria elimination."
39921382,"Plants accumulate starch and triacylglycerols (TAGs) as carbon sources. Leaves primarily store starch in chloroplasts, with some TAGs stored in lipid droplets, but how carbon resource allocation is regulated in leaves during cellular metabolism is largely unknown. Using a forward genetics approach, we isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant with more lipid droplets in its leaves than the wild type, named lipid rich 1 (liri1). The overaccumulation of lipid droplets was caused by the loss of function in the causal gene, encoding an uncharacterized protein. TAG levels were five-fold higher and starch levels two-fold lower in the leaves of liri1 than the wild type. LIRI1 localized to the chloroplasts, and the contents of chloroplast membrane lipids were 20% higher in liri1 leaves than in wild-type leaves. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that LIRI1 interacts with acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase carboxyltransferase alpha subunit (an enzyme for fatty acid biosynthesis) and starch synthase 4 (an enzyme for starch biosynthesis). In isotope tracer experiments using [1-13C]-sodium acetate, more 13C was incorporated into TAGs in liri1 leaves than in wild-type leaves. Moreover, liri1 plants showed growth defects and irregular chloroplasts. These results suggest that LIRI1 affects the carbon trade-off to inhibit lipid production in leaves."
39921338,"Etoposide is an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for DNA transcription, replication, and chromosome segregation. It is well accepted that etoposide triggers cell death due to DNA damage. Our results indicate that multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to etoposide-induced apoptosis, including the overexpression of the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and its oligomerization, forming a mega-channel that releases pro-apoptotic proteins, thereby activating apoptosis. Etoposide induces C-terminal truncation of VDAC1 (VDAC1-ΔC) via the proteolytic actions of calpain-1 and asparagine endopeptidase (AEP). A calpain-specific inhibitor effectively prevented etoposide-induced VDAC1-ΔC formation, apoptosis, and the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Additionally, etoposide upregulates the expression levels of apoptosis regulators (p53, Bax, p21, AIF) and of the proteases calpain and AEP. Etoposide-induced apoptosis and VDAC1 truncation are cell-type dependent and associated with calpain levels and activity. Etoposide-induced VDAC1-ΔC formation and apoptosis are tightly linked: as both display similar patterns of concentration- and time-dependence, both are inhibited by calpain and AEP inhibitors, as well as the VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor VBIT-4, and are dependent on intracellular Ca2+. These findings highlight the complexity of etoposide's actions in different cellular contexts, suggest possible mechanisms of resistance, offer potential biomarkers for guiding etoposide treatment in cancer patients, and propose targeting VDAC1 and calpain as promising therapeutic strategies in cancer therapy."
39921776,"This study explored the extraction and microencapsulation of essential oil from Pistacia terebinthus cambium layer gum (PTG-EO) using response surface methodology (RSM) to optimize extraction efficiency. Significant factors such as extraction method, time, and power were optimized for conventional extraction (CE) and microwave-assisted extraction (MAE), yielding 24.48 and 21.97% essential oil, respectively. Encapsulation efficiency was influenced by temperature, water activity, and oil/wall ratio. The chemical profile of PTG-EO revealed α-pinene as the main component (80.65%). Antioxidant activity, assessed using DPPH and ABTS, showed that freeze-dried nanoencapsulated powder (NcP-Fr) exhibited superior radical scavenging activity compared to spray-dried micro-encapsulated powders (McP-Sp). SEM analysis revealed microspherical encapsulation with sizes around 33.52 μm. Thermal degradation studies showed that the essential oil release from the wall material started at approximately 200 °C, with 10.06% of the oil being released by this temperature. X-ray diffraction analysis revealed the crystallinity/amorphous ratio (14.4/85.56%) and confirmed the stable, homogeneous encapsulation structure, supporting the strong antioxidant performance of NcP-Fr."
39921458,"Commercially available Dacron (woven polyester) grafts are used for routine open surgical repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Despite durable and biocompatible, these grafts do not reproduce the natural mechanical properties of the aorta. Therefore, the aim of this project was to develop an innovative graft that additionally exhibits physiological aortic compliance. To achieve this result, multi-layered tubular aortic grafts were created by electrospinning of a thermoplastic polyurethane. To reduce permeability, a gelatin-coating was added. Three groups (G1-3; n = 5) with varying layer designs were evaluated regarding the main mechanical properties of vascular grafts such as suture retention strength, permeability and static and dynamic compliance. G3, which combined electrospinning with a stable silicone-coated inlay was chosen for the fabrication of medical grade thermoplastic polyurethane grafts (Gm; n = 6). Dynamic compliance values of 19.68 ± 11.5%/100 mmHg (50-90 mmHg), 15.18 ± 8.7%/100 mmHg (80-120 mmHg) and 14.56 ± 7.4%/100 mmHg (110-150 mmHg) were achieved. The compliance was higher than for Dacron and ePTFE grafts and comparable to the normal sized ascending aorta of around 16%/100 mmHg in a healthy human and porcine aortic compliance of 14.3%/100 mmHg. Static compliance was successfully tested up to 350 mmHg. No significant changes in graft diameter or delaminations of the graft layers were detected after compliance testing. Therefore, by combining electrospinning with a durable inlay, both elasticity and recoverability are obtained, resulting in a promising alternative to the gold-standard in open-surgical treatment of thoracic aortic pathologies."
39921315,"Strong and tough hydrogels are promising candidates for artificial soft tissues, yet significant challenges remain in developing biocompatible, anti-swelling hydrogels that simultaneously exhibit high strength, fracture strain, toughness, and fatigue resistance. Herein, thermoplastic elastomer-reinforced polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) hydrogels are prepared through a synergistic combination of phase separation, wet-annealing, and quenching. This approach markedly enhances the crystallinity of the hydrogels and the interfacial interaction between PVA and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). This strategy results in the simultaneous improvement of the mechanical properties of the hydrogels, achieving a tensile strength of 11.19 ± 0.80 MPa, toughness of 62.67 ± 10.66 MJ m-3, fracture strain of 1030 ± 106%, and fatigue threshold of 1377.83 ± 62.78 J m-2. Furthermore, the composite hydrogels demonstrate excellent swelling resistance, biocompatibility, and cytocompatibility. This study presents a novel approach for fabricating strong, tough, stretchable, biocompatible, and fatigue- and swelling-resistant hydrogels with promising applications in soft tissues, flexible electronics, and load-bearing biomaterials."
39921264,"Flavones are an important class of building blocks for numerous biologically active molecules, pharmaceuticals, and natural products. Reductive carbonylation of CO2 is a powerful method to provide high-value heterocycles quickly. However, examples of transition metal-catalyzed carbonylation to produce flavones using CO2 are quite scarce, and the related copper-catalyzed carbonylative cyclization of CO2 is not reported. Here, a general procedure is developed for the copper-catalyzed carbonylative C(sp3)-H bond synthesis of flavone using CO2 as the C1 source. Additionally, 13C-labeled flavones are successfully synthesized using [13C]-CO2, demonstrating significant inhibitor activity against MCF-7 cells in antitumor assays. Mechanistic investigations suggest that the phenolic group accelerates CO2 mass transfer by promoting nucleophilic addition to DBU-CO2 complexes, followed by selective intramolecular carbonylative cyclization."
39921184,"We report here a Cu2+-doped layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplatform to load both monocarboxylate transporter inhibitor diclofenac (DC) and lactate oxidase (LOX) for dual modulation of tumor lactate and redox metabolisms to activate immunotherapy through enhanced Cu-mediated chemodynamic therapy (CDT) of tumors. The formed LDH-DC-LOX nanoparticles with a diameter of 55 nm are stable, can be effectively taken up by cancer cells to regulate lactate through both LOX-mediated catalytic conversion and DC-enabled inhibition of extracellular efflux of lactate, and can exert redox metabolism through CDT via Cu2+-mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton-like reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that can be further accumulated via LOX-mediated catalysis. The major advantage of the developed LDH-DC-LOX nanoparticles lies in the therapeutic synergy and cascade that can be achieved through the loaded DC and LOX for enhanced tumor lactate metabolism regulation, for enhanced Cu-mediated CDT and redox metabolism regulation, and for activation of immunotherapy that can further enhances the Cu2+-mediated CDT effect. The developed LDH nanoplatform demonstrated here for effective murine breast tumor treatment provides a new paradigm for dual regulation of lactate and redox metabolisms that may enable synergistic and cascaded combination therapy of different cancer types. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Targeting the tumor microenvironment (TME) to alter tumor metabolic pathways represents a promising strategy for next-generation cancer therapy. Herein, a copper-doped layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanoplatform is developed to co-deliver both diclofenac (DC) and lactate oxidase (LOX) to tumor cells for efficient dual regulation of tumor lactate and redox metabolisms, resulting in synergistic and cascaded chemodynamic therapy/immunotherapy of breast tumors. The developed LDH-DC-LOX nanoparticles can release Cu2+ and DC under an acidic TME, and can act in synergy to reduce TME lactate and generate H2O2, thus modulating redox metabolism and activating anticancer immunotherapy. The secreted cytokine IFN-γ after activation of antitumor immune responses can further mediate enhanced chemodynamic therapy effect through downregulation of cystine/glutamate transporter SLC7A11 to suppress GSH synthesis."
39921183,"Magnesium (Mg)-based implants have become an attractive alternative to conventional permanent implants in the orthopedic field. While biocompatibility, degradation kinetics, and osseointegration of Mg-based implants have been mostly investigated, the impact of degradation products on bone remodeling and potential systemic effects remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early and mid-term local and systemic tissue responses of degrading ultrahigh-purity ZX00 (Mg-Zn-Ca alloy) and ultrahigh-purity Mg (XHP-Mg) pins in a juvenile healthy rat model. The potential differences between implant types (degradable vs. permanent), implantation, and age-related changes were investigated using titanium (Ti), sham-operated, and control groups (non-intervention), respectively. Degradation products of ZX00 and XHP-Mg pins promote osteogenesis in the medullary cavity by upregulating the expression levels of Bmp2 and Opg within 14 days post-surgery. The higher degradation rate of XHP-Mg resulted in the accumulation of degradation products starting from day 3 and upregulation of different genes, particularly Ccl2 and Cepbp. Besides good osseointegration and new bone tissue formation, we found a more parallel hydroxyapatite/collagen orientation along Mg-based pins in the perimeter region compared to Ti pins. In the liver, reduced glycogen levels in Mg-based pins indicated that degradation products promote glycogenolysis, while only the ZX00 group showed a higher serum glucagon level on day 14. Results suggest that degrading ZX00 and XHP-Mg pins stimulate osteogenesis mainly via Bmp2 and Opg and promote glycogenolysis in the liver, while the higher degradation rate of XHP-Mg pins resulted in upregulation of different genes and metabolites. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Bioresorbable magnesium (Mg)-based implants are promising alternative candidates for orthopedic interventions. Until now, a few in vivo studies explored how Mg-based implants promote osteogenesis in the medullary cavity and modulate systemic tissue responses. Herein, results demonstrate i) the degradation rate of the Mg-based implants has a crucial effect on osteogenesis via regulating Bmp2 and Opg expression in the medullary cavity, ii) parallel HAp/collagen matrix pattern in ZX00 and XHP-Mg groups compared to the Ti group, iii) both Mg pins promote glycogenolysis in the liver. Our findings highlight dual role of Mg-based implants in bone remodeling and systemic metabolic modulation. Nevertheless, this is the first study to report the interaction between Mg-based implants and liver metabolism."

39921078,"Complement analysis necessitates strict control of pre-analytical blood handling, including time, temperature, and additives. Here, we compared complement function and activation status across five different serum preparations and two plasma preparations. Serum was collected from ten healthy volunteers using glass tubes without additives, tubes with a silica clot activator (with or without a gel separator), and tubes containing thrombin (with or without a gel separator). Plasma was collected in the presence of EDTA or the thrombin inhibitor lepirudin. Serum and plasma aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Complement functional analysis was performed using Wieslab and Hycult Biotech pathway-specific assays. Complement activation was determined by quantifying specific activation markers: C1s/C1-INH, MASP-1/C1-INH, C3bc, C3bBbP, and sC5b-9. All serum samples exhibited increased complement activation compared to EDTA and lepirudin plasma, with serum tubes containing thrombin and gel separators showing the highest levels of complement activation. However, normal complement function was observed in all serum preparations, indicating that the complement activation and consumption that occurred did not affect complement functional analysis. While all tested serum tubes provided accurate functional activity, the type of tube and the presence of additives like thrombin and gel separators significantly influenced the degree of complement activation. We recommend preparing functionally active serum either in glass tubes or in silica clot activator tubes, and avoiding gel separators. For complement activation studies, lepirudin plasma is preferable over serum due to its complement functional capacity, low level of complement activation, and lack of excessive hemostatic activation."

39920742,"Articular cartilage injury is a serious bone disease that can result in disabilities. With the rapid increase in the aging population, this disorder has become an increasingly important public health issue. Recently, stem cell-based cartilage tissue engineering has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for treating articular cartilage damage. Cellular scaffolds, which are among three key elements of tissue engineering, play significant roles in the repair of damaged articular cartilage by regulating cellular responses and promoting cartilage tissue regeneration. Biological macromolecules are commonly used as scaffold materials owing to their unique properties. For example, natural and synthetic polymer hydrogel scaffolds can effectively mimic the microenvironment of the natural extracellular matrix; exhibit high cytocompatibility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability; and have attracted increasing attention in bone and cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration medicine. Several types of hydrogel scaffolds have been fabricated to treat articular cartilage abnormalities. This article outlines the recent progress in the field of hydrogel scaffolds manufactured from various biomaterials for repairing damaged articular cartilage, discusses their advantages and disadvantages, and proposes directions for their future development."

39920305,"This work aims to investigate the impact of chitosan and hydrogen peroxide on the growth and seasonal yield of lime trees cultivated in commercial orchards in Qalyubiyya Governorate, Egypt, during the 2021 & 2022 seasons. The treatments include foliar spraying of two concentrations of CHI (100 & 200 ppm) and H2O2 (2 & 4 cm/L), either individually or in combination, at two distinct times, one month after fruit set (1st week of September) and after two months. The hypothesis was that applying chitosan and hydrogen peroxide would improve tree growth, fruit quality, and total production. The obtained results indicated that the combinations of CHI with H2O2 improved tree growth, leaf mineral composition, seasonal yield, and fruit quality parameters. CHI at 200 ppm + H2O2 at 4 cm/L was the most efficient treatment and achieved the largest tree canopy. Treatment of 100 ppm CHI with 2 cm/L H2O2 showed superior yield in terms of tree yield (23.56 & 29.64 kg/tree), total production (8.15 & 9.16 t/ha) compared to other treatments. Likewise, combinations of CHI and H2O2 improved fruit characteristics. Findings of this study demonstrated that the foliar application of CHI with H2O2 could be a promising application to improve seasonal lemon yield and fruit quality in commercial orchards."
39920190,"In this experiment Artocarpus hirsutus (AH) fiber was utilized as the filler material for bamboo fiber (NF)/polyethylene (PE) biocomposites. This was a waste to wealth approach by utilising biomaterial and also can reduce the use of PE plastics. The crystallinity index (Crl) of 45.1%, 56.4%, 67% was observed in AH, alkali treated (NaOH) and cellulose AH fiber respectively. The combination with 20 wt% NF/3 wt% cellulose AH filler observed better tensile and flexural strength. Agglomeration at 4, 5 wt% affects the flexural properties by lesser interfacial adhesion with filler/matrix phase, having properties reducing up to 20.3 MPa. Comparing to cellulose AH filler, both alkali treated and untreated AH filler combinations possess lesser flexural strength. The addition of natural fibers increases the tensile and flexural modulus property with better properties at 30 wt% NF/5 wt% cellulose AH filler combination. The Impact strength doesn't observe high influence with filler incorporation. This AH fiber hasn't been explored in detail for mechanical and hydrophilic properties with incorporation with PE matrix. This fabricated composite is suited for bioengineering applications."
39920129,"Uncontrolled haemorrhage is a leading cause of trauma-related fatalities, highlighting the critical need for rapid and effective haemostasis. Current haemostatic materials encounter limitations such as slow clotting and weak mechanical strength, while most of bioadhesives compromise their adhesion performance to wet tissues for biocompatibility and degradability. In this study, a molecular self-assembly strategy is proposed, developing a biocompatible and biodegradable protein-based patch with excellent adhesion performance. This strategy utilizes fibrinogen modified with hydrophobic groups to induce self-assembly into a hydrogel, which is converted into a dry patch. The protein patch enhances adhesion performance on the wet tissue through a dry cross-linking method and robust intra/inter-molecular interactions. This patch demonstrates excellent haemostatic efficacy in  both porcine oozing wound and porcine severe acute haemorrhage. It maintains biological functionality, and ensures sustained wound sealing while gradually degrading in vivo, making it a promising candidate for clinical tissue sealing applications."

39919189,"The COVID-19 pandemic caused a global health crisis that resulted in millions of deaths. Effective vaccines have played central roles in curtailing the pandemic. Here, we developed a down-converting near-infrared IIb (NIR-IIb; 1500 to 1700 nanometers) luminescent, pure NaErF4@NaYF4 rare-earth nanoparticle (pEr) as vaccine carriers. The pEr nanoparticles were coated with three layers of cross-linked biocompatible polymers (pEr-P3; ~55 nanometers) and conjugated to the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. Upon subcutaneous injection of the pEr-P3-RBD nanovaccine in mice, in vivo NIR-IIb imaging revealed active vaccine trafficking and migration to lymph nodes through lymphatic vessels. Two doses of the adjuvant-free vaccine elicited long-lasting (>7 months) high titers of serum viral neutralization antibody and anti-RBD immunoglobulin G, along with robust RBD-specific germinal center B cells and T follicular helper cells. We devised in vivo NIR-II molecular imaging of RBD-specific cells in lymph nodes, opening noninvasive assessments of vaccine-elicited immune responses longitudinally."
39918943,"Rapid and accurate detection plays a critical role in improving the survival and prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease, but traditional detection methods are far from ideal for those with suspected conditions. Metabolite analysis based on nanomatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (NMALDI-MS) is considered to be a promising technique for disease diagnosis. However, the performance of core nanomatrixes has limited its clinical application. In this study, we constructed 3D flower-shaped cages based on controllable structured metal-organic frameworks and iron oxide nanoparticles with low thermal conductivity and significant photothermal effects. The elongation of the incident light path through multilayer reflection significantly enhances the effective light absorption area of the nanomatrixes. Concurrently, the alternating layered structure confines the thermal energy, reducing thermal losses. Moreover, the 3D structure increases affinity sites, expanding the detection coverage. This approach effectively enhances the laser ionization and thermal desorption efficiency during the LDI process. We applied this technology to analyze the serum metabolomes of patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure, and heart failure combined with myocardial infarction, achieving cost-effective, high-throughput, highly accurate, and user-friendly detection of cardiovascular diseases. Subsequently, deep analysis of detected serum fingerprints via artificial intelligence models screens potential metabolic biomarkers, providing a new paradigm for the accurate diagnosis of cardiovascular diseases."
39918759,"In orthopaedic clinical applications, creating biocomposite bone substitutes to take the place of autologous bone transplants is still difficult. Studies have demonstrated for decades that poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) [PLGA], a common polymer, has many benefits that make it a strong contender for bone replacement. These include biodegradability, good mechanical qualities, and the ability to induce new bone production. Although calcium-based materials are frequently used as bone fillers in bone implantation, the efficiency of ceramic materials containing calcium may be hampered by a number of issues, including low microporosity and quick rates of degradation. In order to overcome these obstacles, scientists are investigating ways to improve implant performance by combining PLGA with other materials, especially in terms of encouraging improved connections with nearby bone cells. An overview of the chemical properties of different PLGA-based scaffold composites, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of PLGA-Calcium implants in tissue engineering applications, are the goals of this review. It also highlights the possible advantages and consequences of using PLGA in 3D printing technology to improve bone tissue engineering clinical outcomes."
39918462,"Bithiazole-based poly(arylenevinylene) is synthesized via the Co-catalyzed hydroarylation polyaddition of N,N,N',N'-tetrahexyl-(2,2'-bithiazole)-4,4'-dicarboxamide with 2,7-diethynyl-9,9-bis(2-ethylhexyl)fluorene in a regioselective manner. The introduction of the 2,2'-bithiazole unit deepens the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels of the polymer compared to the analogous bithiophene-based poly(arylenevinylene). N-Methylation and N-oxidation of the thiazole moiety further deepen the HOMO and LUMO energy levels of the polymer, which is attributed to the enhanced electron-withdrawing effect. The N-oxidized polymer exhibits a high photoluminescence quantum yield and serves as an emitting material in an organic light-emitting diode, and its deep HOMO energy level efficiently restrains the trapping of holes in the host poly(vinylcarbazole) matrix."
39921828,"Lumpy skin disease (LSD) is a highly contagious and fatal transboundary viral disease of cattle and water buffaloes caused by the Lumpy Skin Disease virus (LSDV) which belongs to the genus Capripoxvirus of the Poxviridae family. The disease causes huge economic impact and has been listed as a notifiable disease by World Organization for Animal Health. We present the molecular epidemiology of an LSD outbreak, the first-ever outbreak of the disease in the Union Territory (UT) of Jammu and Kashmir, India; a region lying in Northern Himalayas. During the outbreak, 1661 samples were collected from clinically affected, in-contact cattle as well as apparently healthy animals and screened for LSDV by qPCR. From these 1661 samples, 643 (38.7%) were found positive. Five LSDV-positive samples were randomly selected and the GPCR gene was amplified, cloned and sequenced. A 12-nucleotide deletion was observed in the GPCR gene when compared to the 2019 Indian LSDV isolate from Odhisa, India. Based on the data obtained by qPCR analysis, the occurrence of LSD was determined with respect to the age, sex and breed of the animals. Furthermore, ticks collected from the affected animals and flies on the farm were identified and were found positive for LSDV."
39921799,"Junín virus (JUNV) is a mammarenavirus that causes Argentine hemorrhagic fever (AHF). Mammarenaviruses are RNA viruses with an ambisense, bi-segmented genome containing four genes encoding the glycoproteins (GPC), the nucleoprotein (NP), the RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix protein (Z). Several JUNV strains with different pathogenicity have already been fully sequenced. We performed a comprehensive and comparative analysis of their genetic differences and phylogeny, focusing on the synonymous codon usage patterns of the JUNV proteins. We found a nucleotide identity of > 95% between strains, with significant differences between all genes for GC% and Z and L genes for GC3%. Analysis of relative synonymous codon usage showed that codons AGA and AGG of the amino acid arginine were overrepresented, while CGC, CGA and CGG of arginine, GCG of alanine, ACG of threonine, CCG of proline and TCG of serine were underrepresented in the GPC, NP and L genes. A weak codon usage bias was observed, with GPC having a significantly higher effective number of codons. Moreover, selection could explain at least 83% of the observed bias. Analysis of the codon adaptation index revealed a better adaptation for B cells and kidney and a lower one for endothelial cells. We also observed a possible reassortment event between the MC2 and Romero strains. This work provides a new perspective on the genetic diversity of JUNV strains, which may contribute to the development of new approaches for future research into the evolutionary model, origin and host adaptation of JUNV causing AHF."
39921690,"We recently discovered a novel member of the family Arteriviridae, hedgehog arterivirus 1 (HhAV-1), in the brains of hedgehogs with fatal encephalitis. In this study, we classified this virus and investigated its intrahost genomic diversity using next-generation sequencing. We sequenced HhAV-1 genomes from specimens from seven hedgehogs (two males and five females) with signs of encephalitis that were collected in Buckinghamshire, Gloucestershire, and Cambridgeshire, England, and had died or been euthanised between 2013 and 2024. Analysis of the intrahost populations of these seven HhAV-1 isolates and a previously described isolate revealed the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were most frequent in open reading frames 5, 6, and 7, encoding glycoprotein 5, the membrane protein, and the nucleocapsid protein. Pairwise comparisons of the eight HhAV-1 variants showed that the nucleotide sequence identity values in their combined complete coding sequences ranged from 76.2% to 100%. The eight HhAV-1 variants also shared at least 82.8% amino acid sequence identity in five domains that are involved in replication and are used for the classification of nidoviruses: 3CLpro, NiRAN, RdRp, ZBD, and HEL1. In a replicase-based phylogenetic tree of members of the family Arteriviridae, the HhAV-1 variants formed a sister cluster to African pouched rat arterivirus. A DEmARC-based pairwise distance analysis indicated that these viruses may comprise a new species, for which we propose the name ""Xiarterivirus erinaceid"", in a new genus in the subfamily Heroarterivirinae."
39921615,"Mpox, is a zoonotic disease caused by the monkeypox virus and is primarily endemic to Africa. As countries gradually stop smallpox vaccination, resistance to the smallpox virus is declining, increasing the risk of infection with mpox and other viruses. On 14 August 2024, the World Health Organization announced that the spread of mpox constituted a public health emergency of international concern. Mpox's transmission routes and symptoms are complex and pose new challenges to global health. Several vaccines (such as ACAM2000, JYNNEOS, LC16m8, and genetically engineered vaccines) and antiviral drugs (such as tecovirimat, brincidofovir, cidofovir, and varicella immunoglobulin intravenous injection) have been developed and marketed to prevent and control this disease. This review aims to introduce the epidemic situation, epidemiological characteristics, physiological and pathological characteristics, and preventive measures for mpox in detail, to provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of mpox viruses worldwide."
39921609,"Human adenoviruses (HAdVs) cause diverse disease presentations as pathogens and are also used as viral vectors for vaccines and gene therapy products. Pre-existing adaptive immune responses to HAdV are known to influence symptom severity, viral clearance and the success of viral vectored products. Of note, approximately 50% of the UK's adult population has received at least one dose of a chimpanzee adenovirus vectored SARS-CoV-2 vaccine (ChAdOx1) since January 2021. We used FluoroSpot analysis to quantify the interferon-gamma (IFNγ) and interleukin-2 (IL2) responses of healthy blood donors to HAdV species A, B, C, D and F and chimpanzee adenovirus Y25, related to HAdV species E. We find that cellular immune responses to multiple species of human adenovirus are ubiquitous among healthy adult blood donors and that stimulating PBMC with whole hexon peptide libraries induces a significantly greater IFNγ and IL2 response than using selected peptide pools alone. We then compared the cellular immune responses of ChAdOx1 recipients and control donors using PBMC collected in 2021 and found that homotypic and heterotypic IFNγ responses were significantly boosted in ChAdOx1 recipients but not controls. Finally, we show that in PBMC derived from blood donors, IFNγ responses are made to both conserved and variable regions of the hexon protein. Future vaccination campaigns using adenoviral vectored vaccines will need to account for the pre-existing exposure of recipients to both circulating HAdVs and vaccines such as ChAdOx1, which convey polyfunctional antiviral T cell responses to even low seroprevalence HAdV types."
39921608,"Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a major global public health threat, especially with the emergence of antiviral resistance, highlighting the urgent need for novel therapeutics. Alkaloids are known for their antiviral properties, and chemical synthesis has become a key strategy in developing new alkaloid compounds. In this study, we synthesized a series of novel alkaloids using the Ugi reaction and assessed their antiviral potential and mechanisms. Through screening and validation, Zj6-11 was identified as a promising compound that effectively inhibits IAV infection in vitro. Molecular docking and binding affinity assays showed that Zj6-11 binds with high affinity to IAV nucleoprotein (NP) and inhibits its interaction with nucleic acids. Further, in vitro nuclear translocation assays confirmed that Zj6-11 suppresses NP nuclear import. Mechanistically, Zj6-11 significantly inhibits IAV-induced apoptosis and mitigates mitochondrial membrane potential dysfunction. Zj6-11 also inhibits cytochrome c release, reduces the expression of cleaved Caspase-9 and Caspase-3, and suppresses IAV-induced apoptosis-inducing factor (Aif) expression, suppressing IAV-induced mitochondrial apoptosis. More importantly, Zj6-11 plays a crucial role in protecting mice from IAV infection and reducing IAV pathogenicity. Our study provides mechanistic insights into Zj6-11's control of IAV infection in vitro and in vivo, offering new perspectives for antiviral therapy development."
39921602,"The lack of effective antiviral treatments for enteroviruses, including human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), have resulted in an immense global healthcare burden associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). Rocaglates and aglains belong to a family of compounds produced by Aglaia genus plants. Since the initial discovery of rocaglates in 1982, various rocaglates and aglains have been synthesized and extensively studied mainly as anticancer agents. Here, we report the discovery of a novel aglain derivative as a potential EV-A71 inhibitor. From an immunofluorescence-based phenotypic screen of a library of 296 rocaglate and aglain derivatives, we identified a lead aglain which effectively suppressed EV-A71 replication by 2.3 log fold at a non-cytotoxic concentration, with a host cell CC50 of 21.78 µM, an EV-A71 infection EC50 of 3.57 µM, and a selectivity index of 6.1. Further validation revealed inhibition of EV-A71 across multiple human cell types and a pan-enterovirus inhibitory spectrum against other enteroviruses. Subsequent mechanistic investigation revealed interference with EV-A71 intracellular post-entry events including viral RNA transcription and translation. Findings from this study have established a strong foundation for development of aglain scaffolds as much needed antiviral agents for HFMD, paving the way for future medicinal chemistry optimization and in vivo studies."
39921601,"Understanding how interpersonal interactions and immunological factors shape SARS-CoV-2 transmission in households is crucial for designing control measures. We developed a Bayesian data augmentation transmission model to evaluate the effects of isolation, parental care, and vaccine-induced immunity on Delta variant transmission from the follow-up of 1,093 Israeli households (July-August 2021). Among the 2883 household contacts, 1096 (38%) were infected. Children were 38% (CI: 7-81) more likely to be infected than adults. Isolation measures reduced transmission by 52% (CI: 46-57). Transmission was 39% (CI: 11-76) higher between children and adult females than males. Vaccine effectiveness was 78% (CI: 54-90), 85% (CI: 70-94), and 73% (CI: 49-88) for one, two, and three doses of recent vaccination (< 90 days), respectively but dropped to 18% (CI: (-6)-36) for two doses administered more than 90 days ago. Household member interactions significantly shaped transmission, and isolation measures effectively reduced transmission."

39921518,"Movement disorders after dengue virus (DENV) infection have been increasingly recognized. We aimed to synthesize the clinical and paraclinical characteristics, treatment responses, and outcomes of these neurologic complications. We systematically reviewed PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS databases up to September 2023 following a published protocol. We identified 73 cases of DENV-induced movement disorders. Cerebellar ataxia was the most common, followed by parkinsonism, opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome, and dystonia. Movement disorders typically developed within 14 days of DENV infection and were associated with a range of neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment and psychiatric disturbances. Neuroimaging studies frequently showed abnormalities in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Treatment varied depending on the specific movement disorder and included corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and symptomatic medications. Whereas a handful of cases met the criteria for acute encephalitis, many lacked sufficient data to establish a definitive diagnosis. Para-infectious and postinfectious immune-mediated movement disorders were also reported. A rare case of chronic progressive panencephalitis due to DENV infection highlights the potential for long-term neurological consequences. Other DENV-related complications, such as stroke, pituitary apoplexy, subacute thyroiditis, and metabolic disturbances, can also cause movement disorders. We emphasize the importance of recognizing the diverse neurological manifestations of DENV infection and the need for further research to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and optimize treatment strategies. We propose a more rigorous approach to determining the causality between infection and movement disorder, demanding stronger evidence beyond mere association and advocating for targeted research to fill the existing knowledge gaps. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society."
39921425,"Further phytochemical investigation on the twigs of Trichilia connaroides led to the isolation of nine limonoids (1, 2, and 5-11), one 3,4-seco-homo-cycloartane (3), and two steroids (4 and 12). The structures of these obtained isolates were established by means of detailed analyses of their extensive spectroscopic information and ECD calculations, four of them were elucidated as undescribed compounds (1-4). It is noted that an unprecedented 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane moiety in trichilitin M (1) was proposed by the linkage of C-11 and C-14 via an oxygen atom.  All compounds were evaluated for their anti-tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) activities by the conventional half-leaf method and RT-PCR assays. Compared with the positive control ningnanmycin, compounds 1, 6, 7, and 11 showed signiﬁcant anti-TMV biological activities. Futhermore, qRT-PCR assays suggested that the expression level of the TMV CP gene in inoculated and systemic K326 leaves treated by both 1 and 6, was significantly lower than that for the control group. More importantly, compounds 1 and 6 could not only inhibit the accumulation of TMV CP gene, but also enhance the host plant's resistance to TMV infection."
39921395,"During the autumn/winter respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemics, bacterial co-infection is common and affects the disease severity. We aimed to understand the relationship between RSV-bacterial co-infections and clinical severity since the RSV seasonality change after COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a prospective, sentinel surveillance study at 20 sites in Portugal in children under 2 years hospitalized with RSV, between April 21 and January 23. Effect of co-infection with potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) on the length of hospitalization and disease severity was investigated using multivariate linear and log-binomial regression models. Among 678 RSV hospitalizations, 67.4% occurred in children under 6 months and 15.3% in preterm; 20.4% tested positive for PPB; median length of hospitalization was 5 days (IQR: 3-7days). Children coinfected with PPB had a higher rate of ICU admission (29.7% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.001), resulting in more prolonged hospitalizations (7 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001) and a 13-fold risk of having severe disease (RR: 13.2, 95% CI:7.3-23.9). RSV-bacterial co-infection was associated with increased length of hospitalization and severe illness during off-season epidemics. This risk is probably overestimated, as laboratory testing for bacterial infections is usually higher in severely ill-appearing children. Measures to prevent outgrowth of pathogenic bacteria within the respiratory tract should be discussed."
39921385,"In recent years, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) has surpassed enterovirus A71 to become the main pathogen causing severe Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease (HFMD) in China with a substantial disease burden. However, there is currently no commercial CVA6 vaccine. The D3a genotype of CVA6 is the predominant genotype in China. In this study, virus-like particles (VLPs) and mRNA vaccines based on the CVA6 sub-genotype D3a were successfully developed. The immunogenicity and protective effects of the VLP of CVA6 combined with Al(OH)3 and CpG adjuvant indicated that VLP-induced neutralizing antibodies against three CVA6 sub-genotype (D2, D3a, and D3b) strains in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice, and the combination of the two adjuvants enhanced cellular immunity. Passive immunization with serum from mice immunized with VLPs protected suckling mice against CVA6 lethal challenge in both antiserum transfer and maternal immunization experiments. The immunogenicity and protective effects of the mRNA vaccine of CVA6 indicate that it induces robust T-cell immunity. T-cell immunity was found to cross-protect against coxsackievirus A10 infection in mice. This is the first trial of a CVA6 mRNA vaccine worldwide and the first comparison of the immunogenicity and protective effects of VLP and mRNA vaccines based on D3a CVA6. The study provides a theoretical basis for the development of enteroviruses vaccines and the formulation of immunization strategies."
39921375,"Human immunodeficiency virus is associated with the development of various aggressive non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphomas (NHL). Despite this, people living with HIV (PLWH) are often excluded from clinical trials. Here we analyze the change in clinical trial exclusion among PLWH resulting from multilateral advocacy efforts since 2017."
39921366,"Asian and pacific region countries are considered to be high risk countries for Human Immunodeficiency Viruses (HIV). There is little literature quantifying the relationship between education of HIV/AIDS and its principal socioeconomic determinants through a spatial analysis. The purpose of this study was to assess the knowledge and awareness about HIV among the women in Thailand, and its direct and indirect association with sociodemographic factors including sexual education, level of education, area of living and wealth index through a structural equation modelling approach."
