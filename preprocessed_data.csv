39921842,"Aberrant activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, primarily driven by APC mutation and AXIN degradation via Tankyrase, contributes significantly to colorectal cancer (CRC) progression and metastasis. The accumulation of β-catenin, resulting from the dysregulated ubiquitination, underscores the need for alternative therapeutic strategies targeting Tankyrase and β-catenin. This present study explores microbial metabolites as a source of novel anti-cancer agents, leveraging their unique bioactivity and structural diversity, often exhibiting superior target specificity and lower toxicity than synthetic drugs. Through a computational drug discovery pipeline, a large library of 27641 microbial metabolites was initially screened based on multiple drug-likeliness criteria, resulting in the selection of 2527 compounds. Among the screened compounds, an integrated computational workflow comprising molecular docking, molecular dynamic simulations (MDS), MM/PBSA analysis, and Principal component analysis (PCA) identified Terreustoxin I (T1) as a potential Tankyrase inhibitor. In contrast, compound 10- phenyl-[12]-cytochalasin Z16 (B1) demonstrated a strong binding affinity within the β-catenin active site. Under physiological conditions, these lead compounds were evaluated for conformational stability, binding efficacy, and dynamic behavior. Additionally, ADMET profiling, physiochemical properties, and bioactivity score predictions confirmed the identified compounds' pharmacokinetic suitability and reduced toxicity profile. In silico, cytotoxicity predictions showed significant activity against SW480 and HCT90 colorectal cell lines, with additional anti-neoplastic and anti-leukemic properties, strengthening their candidacy as effective anti-cancer agents. These findings provide a foundation for further experimental validation and development of novel CRC therapies with improved safety and efficacy potential.","aberrant activation wnt/-catenin signaling pathway , primarily driven apc mutation axin degradation via tankyrase , contributes significantly colorectal cancer crc progression metastasis . accumulation -catenin , resulting dysregulated ubiquitination , underscore need alternative therapeutic strategy targeting tankyrase -catenin . present study explores microbial metabolite source novel anti-cancer agent , leveraging unique bioactivity structural diversity , often exhibiting superior target specificity lower toxicity synthetic drug . computational drug discovery pipeline , large library 27641 microbial metabolite initially screened based multiple drug-likeliness criterion , resulting selection 2527 compound . among screened compound , integrated computational workflow comprising molecular docking , molecular dynamic simulation md , mm/pbsa analysis , principal component analysis pca identified terreustoxin t1 potential tankyrase inhibitor . contrast , compound 10- phenyl-12-cytochalasin z16 b1 demonstrated strong binding affinity within -catenin active site . physiological condition , lead compound evaluated conformational stability , binding efficacy , dynamic behavior . additionally , admet profiling , physiochemical property , bioactivity score prediction confirmed identified compound pharmacokinetic suitability reduced toxicity profile . silico , cytotoxicity prediction showed significant activity sw480 hct90 colorectal cell line , additional anti-neoplastic anti-leukemic property , strengthening candidacy effective anti-cancer agent . finding provide foundation experimental validation development novel crc therapy improved safety efficacy potential ."

Heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) is ubiquitously expressed in most cell types and participates in controlling many survival pathways. Cancer cells utilize HSP90 in order to prolong their survival, thus they tend to overexpress it. Based on its importance for cancer cells, we aim to investigate the molecular mechanisms that link HSP90 inhibition in colon cancer cells with oxidative stress and mitochondrial stress-related regulators.","cancer cell modulate expression many protein essential supporting uncontrolled proliferation . heat shock protein 90 hsp90 ubiquitously expressed cell type participates controlling many survival pathway . cancer cell utilize hsp90 order prolong survival , thus tend overexpress . based importance cancer cell , aim investigate molecular mechanism link hsp90 inhibition colon cancer cell oxidative stress mitochondrial stress-related regulator ."

39921761,"Ingenol mebutate (IM), a diterpene ester derived from Euphorbia species, has demonstrated promising anticancer properties through direct cytotoxicity and immune modulation. Despite initial clinical success, its therapeutic use has been curtailed due to safety concerns, including potential links to increased skin cancer risk. This review evaluates the mechanisms of action, preclinical and clinical efficacy, safety, and limitations of IM as an anticancer agent, identifying areas for further development. A comprehensive literature review was performed using Google Scholar to identify English-language articles published from 2010 to 2023. Keywords included ""Ingenol mebutate,"" ""PEP005,"" and ""cancer therapy."" Articles focusing on IM's pharmacological properties, therapeutic mechanisms, clinical studies, and safety profile were included. IM exerts anticancer effects through dual mechanisms: mitochondrial dysfunction leading to necrosis and immune-mediated cytotoxicity via protein kinase C activation. Preclinical studies show efficacy against pancreatic, colorectal, and epithelial cancers and clinical studies have reported success in treating actinic keratosis and nonmelanoma skin cancers. Challenges include intense local skin reactions and safety concerns, particularly its potential association with increased skin malignancy risk. IM represents a promising therapeutic agent due to its rapid and potent anticancer effects. However, optimizing its safety profile and exploring advanced delivery methods are critical to expanding its clinical applications.

39921520,"Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers worldwide and liver metastasis is the leading reason for its mortality. Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are conclusively associated with the progression of various cancers, rendering the exploration of its specific mechanisms in colorectal cancer liver metastasis(CRLM) highly valuable. Combined with GEO (Gene Expression Omnibus) databases and clinical data in our center, we found that high expression of circSATB1 is closely related to the progression of CRLM. Functionally, circSATB1 could significantly promote the metastatic ability of CRC cells in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, circSATB1 facilitated the RNF25-mediated ubiquitylation and degradation of FKBP8, releasing its inhibitory effects on mTOR signaling. In this process, circSATB1 acted as a scaffold for RNF25-FKBP8 complexes. Additionally, circSATB1 could be packaged in exosomes and secreted from the CRC primary tumors into plasma. In conclusion, this study uncovered a new circSATB1 that acts as a potent promoter of CRLM and offers novel insights into the precision therapeutic strategies for CRLM.","colorectal cancer crc one common cancer worldwide liver metastasis leading reason mortality . circular rna circrnas conclusively associated progression various cancer , rendering exploration specific mechanism colorectal cancer liver metastasiscrlm highly valuable . combined geo gene expression omnibus database clinical data center , found high expression circsatb1 closely related progression crlm . functionally , circsatb1 could significantly promote metastatic ability crc cell vitro vivo . mechanistically , circsatb1 facilitated rnf25-mediated ubiquitylation degradation fkbp8 , releasing inhibitory effect mtor signaling . process , circsatb1 acted scaffold rnf25-fkbp8 complex . additionally , circsatb1 could packaged exosomes secreted crc primary tumor plasma . conclusion , study uncovered new circsatb1 act potent promoter crlm offer novel insight precision therapeutic strategy crlm ."
39921517,"Industrial food processing has been linked to various health outcomes including cancer. To examine associations between the degree of food processing and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) and its sub-sites, data from the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer (EPIC) including 6155 incident CRC cases (n = 450,111 participants), were analyzed. Dietary intakes were assessed using baseline food frequency questionnaires. Foods were classified into culinary ingredients, unprocessed, processed (PFs), and ultra-processed foods (UPFs) according to the Nova classification. Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted for established CRC risk factors, were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) associated with a 10% increase in proportion of consumption (%g/d) of each Nova group. Substitution analysis examined the effect of replacing UPFs and PFs with unprocessed foods on CRC risk. A 10% increase in proportion of UPFs was associated with 6% higher CRC risk (95% CI:1.02-1.10). A positive association was also found between PFs and CRC risk (HR per 10% increase: 1.10 [95% CI, 1.05-1.15]). Conversely, unprocessed food consumption was inversely associated with CRC risk (HR per 10% increase: 0.93[95% CI, 0.90-0.95]). Substitution of 10% of the overall proportion of the diet comprising UPFs or PFs with 10% unprocessed foods was associated with a decreased risk of CRC (HRUPFs: 0.94 [95% CI, 0.90-0.97]; HRPFs: 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86-0.94]). In conclusion, UPF was positively associated with CRC risk while diets richer in unprocessed foods were associated with lower CRC risk. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanisms by which food processing affects CRC risk.","industrial food processing linked various health outcome including cancer . examine association degree food processing risk colorectal cancer crc sub-sites , data european prospective investigation cancer epic including 6155 incident crc case n = 450,111 participant , analyzed . dietary intake assessed using baseline food frequency questionnaire . food classified culinary ingredient , unprocessed , processed pfs , ultra-processed food upfs according nova classification . cox proportional hazard model , adjusted established crc risk factor , used estimate hazard ratio hr 95 % confidence interval 95 % ci associated 10 % increase proportion consumption % g/d nova group . substitution analysis examined effect replacing upfs pfs unprocessed food crc risk . 10 % increase proportion upfs associated 6 % higher crc risk 95 % ci1.02-1.10 . positive association also found pfs crc risk hr per 10 % increase 1.10 95 % ci , 1.05-1.15. conversely , unprocessed food consumption inversely associated crc risk hr per 10 % increase 0.9395 % ci , 0.90-0.95. substitution 10 % overall proportion diet comprising upfs pfs 10 % unprocessed food associated decreased risk crc hrupfs 0.94 95 % ci , 0.90-0.97 hrpfs 0.90 95 % ci , 0.86-0.94. conclusion , upf positively associated crc risk diet richer unprocessed food associated lower crc risk . study needed understand mechanism food processing affect crc risk ."

39921239,"It is increasingly recognized that young, chow-fed inbred mice poorly model the complexity of human carcinogenesis. In humans, age and adiposity are major risk factors for malignancies, but most genetically engineered mouse models (GEMM) induce carcinogenesis too rapidly to study these influences. Standard strains, such as C57BL/6, commonly used in GEMMs, further limit the exploration of aging and metabolic health effects. A similar challenge arises in modeling periodontitis, a disease influenced by aging, diabesity, and genetic architecture. We propose using diverse mouse populations with hybrid vigor, such as the Collaborative Cross (CC) × ApcMin hybrid, to slow disease progression and better model human colorectal cancer (CRC) and comorbidities. This perspective highlights the advantages of this model, where delayed carcinogenesis reveals interactions with aging and adiposity. Unlike ApcMin mice, which develop cancer rapidly, CC × ApcMin hybrids recapitulate human-like progression. This facilitates the identification of modifier loci affecting inflammation, diet susceptibility, organ size, and polyposis distribution. The CC × ApcMin model offers a transformative platform for studying CRC as a disease of adulthood, reflecting its complex interplay with aging and comorbidities. The insights gained from this approach will enhance early detection, management, and treatment strategies for CRC and related conditions.","increasingly recognized young , chow-fed inbred mouse poorly model complexity human carcinogenesis . human , age adiposity major risk factor malignancy , genetically engineered mouse model gemm induce carcinogenesis rapidly study influence . standard strain , c57bl/6 , commonly used gemms , limit exploration aging metabolic health effect . similar challenge arises modeling periodontitis , disease influenced aging , diabesity , genetic architecture . propose using diverse mouse population hybrid vigor , collaborative cross cc apcmin hybrid , slow disease progression better model human colorectal cancer crc comorbidities . perspective highlight advantage model , delayed carcinogenesis reveals interaction aging adiposity . unlike apcmin mouse , develop cancer rapidly , cc apcmin hybrid recapitulate human-like progression . facilitates identification modifier locus affecting inflammation , diet susceptibility , organ size , polyposis distribution . cc apcmin model offer transformative platform studying crc disease adulthood , reflecting complex interplay aging comorbidities . insight gained approach enhance early detection , management , treatment strategy crc related condition ."

39920526,"The high occurrence and death rates of colorectal cancer (CRC) make it a major health concern. Recent studies have identified NOP2/Sun RNA methyltransferase family member 2 (NSUN2), an RNA methyltransferase, as a key regulator in various tumor types. However, how exactly NSUN2-mediated m5C alteration affects CRC is still a mystery. This study seeks to understand how NSUN2 contributes to the growth and death of colorectal cancer cells. New tissue samples were taken in order to investigate NSUN2 expression in CRC. In vitro tests were performed to evaluate NSUN2's function. We used m5C-methylated-RNA immunoprecipitation and RNA stability experiments to find out how NSUN2 works on Solute carrier family 7 member 11 (SLC7A11, also called xCT). Downregulation of NSUN2 limits CRC cell growth and induces ferroptosis, as we show that NSUN2 was substantially expressed in CRC. In terms of the molecular mechanism, NSUN2 controls the translation and stability of SLC7A11 mRNA by regulating its m5C methylation. Functional tests show that SLC7A11 compensates for the NSUN2 knockdown-induced decrease in cell proliferation. Additionally, SLC7A11 overexpression restores ferroptosis to CRC cells after NSUN2 knockdown. These findings emphasize NSUN2's crucial role in modulating colorectal cancer cell growth and survival via SLC7A11, pointing to promising new therapeutic targets.","high occurrence death rate colorectal cancer crc make major health concern . recent study identified nop2/sun rna methyltransferase family member 2 nsun2 , rna methyltransferase , key regulator various tumor type . however , exactly nsun2-mediated m5c alteration affect crc still mystery . study seek understand nsun2 contributes growth death colorectal cancer cell . new tissue sample taken order investigate nsun2 expression crc . vitro test performed evaluate nsun2s function . used m5c-methylated-rna immunoprecipitation rna stability experiment find nsun2 work solute carrier family 7 member 11 slc7a11 , also called xct . downregulation nsun2 limit crc cell growth induces ferroptosis , show nsun2 substantially expressed crc . term molecular mechanism , nsun2 control translation stability slc7a11 mrna regulating m5c methylation . functional test show slc7a11 compensates nsun2 knockdown-induced decrease cell proliferation . additionally , slc7a11 overexpression restores ferroptosis crc cell nsun2 knockdown . finding emphasize nsun2s crucial role modulating colorectal cancer cell growth survival via slc7a11 , pointing promising new therapeutic target ."
39920524,"We aimed to create a NK cell marker genes-based signature to predict immunotherapy response and prognosis in colorectal cancer. We integrated scRNA-seq data from four Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) samples and performed Weighted gene correlation network analysis (WGCNA) based on 587 the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) colorectal cancer samples to uncover NK cell-related genes. We identified 1080 NK cell-related core genes and 276 NK cell-related feature genes based on WGCNA and clustering and annotation of scRNA-seq data, respectively. Six key NK cell-related prognostic signature genes were obtained by univariate and LASSO regression analyses, including ADAM8, CTSD, CCL4, IL2RB, TTC38, and PLEK. Two validation cohorts from the GEO dataset, comprising 124 and 201 samples respectively, were used. The signature was significantly associated with overall survival and correlated with immune cell infiltration, immune and stromal scores, and immune checkpoint genes. Furthermore, the signature was associated with the homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and T-cell receptor (TCR) scores.

39920491,"Germline pathogenic variants of the RPS20 (ribosomal protein S20) gene are suspected to be involved in the predisposition to familial colorectal cancer (CRC) with no DNA mismatch repair deficiency. RPS20 pathogenic variants are very rare with only five reported cases in the literature. We report in this work the retrospective germline analysis of RPS20 for 1035 consecutive patients with a personal and/or familial history suggestive of hereditary predisposition to CRC. Within this series, a pathogenic variant in known CRC genes was found in 15% of cases and we describe one RPS20 loss-of-function variant (NM_001146227.1:c.115_116del, p.(Leu39Aspfs*33)). This frameshift is the first reported de novo variant in CRC, it was identified in in a female patient diagnosed with rectal cancer at the age of 35, 11 adenomatous polyps in 5 years and breast cancer at the age of 43. RPS20 has an intriguing role in oncogenesis, acting as an oncogene or tumour suppressor depending on the context, and is also involved in Diamond-Blackfan anemia via gain of function or dominant negative variants. This is therefore a complex gene for genetic counselling and, given the rarity of RPS20 pathogenic variants, we emphasise the need to collect data to clarify the phenotypic spectrum of RPS20-associated cancers and thus improve management.","germline pathogenic variant rps20 ribosomal protein s20 gene suspected involved predisposition familial colorectal cancer crc dna mismatch repair deficiency . rps20 pathogenic variant rare five reported case literature . report work retrospective germline analysis rps20 1035 consecutive patient personal and/or familial history suggestive hereditary predisposition crc . within series , pathogenic variant known crc gene found 15 % case describe one rps20 loss-of-function variant nm001146227.1c.115116del , p.leu39aspfs33 . frameshift first reported de novo variant crc , identified female patient diagnosed rectal cancer age 35 , 11 adenomatous polyp 5 year breast cancer age 43. rps20 intriguing role oncogenesis , acting oncogene tumour suppressor depending context , also involved diamond-blackfan anemia via gain function dominant negative variant . therefore complex gene genetic counselling , given rarity rps20 pathogenic variant , emphasise need collect data clarify phenotypic spectrum rps20-associated cancer thus improve management ."
39920335,"Cancer driver mutations are defined by their high prevalence in cancers and presumed rarity in normal tissues. However, recent studies show that positive selection in normal epithelia can increase the prevalence of some cancer drivers. To determine their true cancer-driving potential, it is essential to evaluate how frequent these mutations are in normal tissues and what are their phenotypes. Here, we explore the bioavailability of somatic variants by quantifying age-related mutational burdens in normal human colonic epithelium using immunodetection in FFPE samples (N = 181 patients). Positive selection of variants of tumour suppressor genes PTEN and ARID1A associates with monoallelic gene loss as confirmed by CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis and changes in their downstream effectors. Comparison of the mutational burden in normal tissue and colorectal cancers allows quantification of cancer driver potency based on relative representation. Additionally, immune exclusion, a cancer hallmark feature, is observed within ARID1A-deficient clones in histologically normal tissue. The behaviour resulting from haploinsufficiency of PTEN and ARID1A demonstrates how somatic mosaicism of tumour suppressors arises and can predispose to cancer initiation.","cancer driver mutation defined high prevalence cancer presumed rarity normal tissue . however , recent study show positive selection normal epithelium increase prevalence cancer driver . determine true cancer-driving potential , essential evaluate frequent mutation normal tissue phenotype . , explore bioavailability somatic variant quantifying age-related mutational burden normal human colonic epithelium using immunodetection ffpe sample n = 181 patient . positive selection variant tumour suppressor gene pten arid1a associate monoallelic gene loss confirmed crispr/cas9 mutagenesis change downstream effector . comparison mutational burden normal tissue colorectal cancer allows quantification cancer driver potency based relative representation . additionally , immune exclusion , cancer hallmark feature , observed within arid1a-deficient clone histologically normal tissue . behaviour resulting haploinsufficiency pten arid1a demonstrates somatic mosaicism tumour suppressor arises predispose cancer initiation ."
39921843,"Influenza A virus (IAV) remains a significant public health concern due to its annual epidemics and potential for global pandemics. Despite the availability of countermeasures such as vaccines and antiviral treatments, their effectiveness is often questioned due to the emergence of novel strains with antiviral resistance and the variable efficacy of influenza vaccines compared to other vaccines. Traditionally, influenza vaccination strategies have focused on matrix, neuraminidase, and nucleoproteins. In this study, considering the crucial roles of HA and RdRp (PA, PB1, and PB2) of Influenza A, a reverse vaccinology approach is put forth in designing a possible promising antigenic protein toward the development of vaccines against H1N1 viruses. With the development of immunoinformatics approach, one can design/construct potential candidates for vaccine formulation against IAV with the epitope segments identified based on B- and T-cell recognition linked via adjuvants like EAAAK, GPGPG, and AAY linkers. Computational assessments of physicochemical properties, antigenicity, immunogenicity, allergenicity, and toxicity predictions, conducted to evaluate the potential of designed vaccine construct, indicated high antigenicity and potential interactions with immune receptors. Molecular docking of the vaccine construct with human immune receptors (MHCI, MHCII, TLR4, TLR7, and TLR8) followed by molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated stable dynamics with strong binding affinity. The computational immune response modeling with multiple dosages suggested significant immune activation by this construct against IAV. In essence, these findings highlight the potential immune property of the vaccine construct, and put forth the need of thorough preclinical assessments in transforming this construct as a vaccine against the challenging IAV pathogens.","influenza virus iav remains significant public health concern due annual epidemic potential global pandemic . despite availability countermeasure vaccine antiviral treatment , effectiveness often questioned due emergence novel strain antiviral resistance variable efficacy influenza vaccine compared vaccine . traditionally , influenza vaccination strategy focused matrix , neuraminidase , nucleoprotein . study , considering crucial role ha rdrp pa , pb1 , pb2 influenza , reverse vaccinology approach put forth designing possible promising antigenic protein toward development vaccine h1n1 virus . development immunoinformatics approach , one design/construct potential candidate vaccine formulation iav epitope segment identified based b- t-cell recognition linked via adjuvant like eaaak , gpgpg , aay linkers . computational assessment physicochemical property , antigenicity , immunogenicity , allergenicity , toxicity prediction , conducted evaluate potential designed vaccine construct , indicated high antigenicity potential interaction immune receptor . molecular docking vaccine construct human immune receptor mhci , mhcii , tlr4 , tlr7 , tlr8 followed molecular dynamic simulation demonstrated stable dynamic strong binding affinity . computational immune response modeling multiple dosage suggested significant immune activation construct iav . essence , finding highlight potential immune property vaccine construct , put forth need thorough preclinical assessment transforming construct vaccine challenging iav pathogen ."

39921600,"Mitochondrial function relies on the coordinated interactions between genes in the mitochondrial (mtDNA) and nuclear genomes. Imperfect interactions following mitonuclear incompatibility may lead to reduced fitness. MtDNA introgressions across species and populations are common and well documented. Various strategies may be expected to reconcile mitonuclear incompatibility in hybrids or admixed individuals. African admixed cattle (Bos taurus × B. indicus) show sex-biased admixture, with taurine (B. taurus) mtDNA and a nuclear genome predominantly of humped zebu (B. indicus). Here, we leveraged local ancestry inference approaches to identify the ancestry and distribution patterns of nuclear functional genes associated with the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation process in the genomes of African admixed cattle. We show that most of the nuclear genes involved in mitonuclear interactions are under selection and of humped zebu ancestry. Variation in mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) may have contributed to the recovery of optimal mitochondrial function following admixture with the regulation of gene expression, alleviating or nullifying mitochondrial dysfunction. Interestingly, some nuclear mitochondrial genes with enrichment in taurine ancestry may have originated from ancient African aurochs (B. primigenius africanus) introgression. They may have contributed to the local adaptation of African cattle to pathogen burdens.

39921490,"Vertebrate embryogenesis requires the precisely timed specification of 3 germ cell layers- ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm- which give rise to tissues and organs in the developing organism. The tumor suppressor gene NF2, moesin-ezrin-radixin like (MERLIN) tumor suppressor (Nf2) is expressed in all 3 germ layers during mouse development and its homozygous deletion causes embryonic lethality. People with heterozygous NF2 mutations typically develop Schwann cell tumors, especially vestibular schwannoma, but the specific role of NF2 in human embryonic development is unclear. Here, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) are used to demonstrate that NF2 is essential for endoderm specification and formation in humans. Although endoderm differentiation is not impaired in hiPSCs with heterozygous NF2 mutation, NF2 knockout (NF2-/-) abolished the capacity to form endoderm in vitro, confirmed by loss of expression of endoderm-related genes and proteins, or teratomas in vivo. This defect is mediated by the nuclear translocation of yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1), a transcription co-activator regulating lineage fate via the Hippo pathway and subsequent YAP1-mediated shutdown of Activin/Nodal signaling. Endoderm formation can be rescued via YAP1 knockdown or forced re-expression of NF2 in NF2-/- cells. Taken together, the essential role of NF2 during endoderm specification in human embryogenesis as a regulator of YAP1 is reported.","vertebrate embryogenesis requires precisely timed specification 3 germ cell layers- ectoderm , mesoderm , endoderm- give rise tissue organ developing organism . tumor suppressor gene nf2 , moesin-ezrin-radixin like merlin tumor suppressor nf2 expressed 3 germ layer mouse development homozygous deletion cause embryonic lethality . people heterozygous nf2 mutation typically develop schwann cell tumor , especially vestibular schwannoma , specific role nf2 human embryonic development unclear . , human induced pluripotent stem cell hipscs used demonstrate nf2 essential endoderm specification formation human . although endoderm differentiation impaired hipscs heterozygous nf2 mutation , nf2 knockout nf2-/- abolished capacity form endoderm vitro , confirmed loss expression endoderm-related gene protein , teratoma vivo . defect mediated nuclear translocation yes-associated protein 1 yap1 , transcription co-activator regulating lineage fate via hippo pathway subsequent yap1-mediated shutdown activin/nodal signaling . endoderm formation rescued via yap1 knockdown forced re-expression nf2 nf2-/- cell . taken together , essential role nf2 endoderm specification human embryogenesis regulator yap1 reported ."
39921431,"Tailored droplet generation is crucial for droplet microfluidics that involve samples of varying sizes. However, the absence of precise predictive models forces droplet platforms to rely on empiricism derived from extensive experiments, underscoring the need for comprehensive modeling analysis. To address this, a novel customized assembled centrifugal step emulsifier (CASE) is presented by incorporating a ""jigsaw puzzles"" design to efficiently acquire large-scale experimental data. Numerical simulations are utilized to analyze fluid configurations during step emulsification, identifying a key connection tube that determines droplet size. By training and verifying with the experimental and simulation datasets, a comprehensive theoretical model is established that allows for the preliminary design of the droplet size and generation frequency with an average error rate of 4.8%, successfully filling a critical gap in existing field. This predictive model empowers the CASE to achieve all-in-one functionality, including droplet pre-design, generation, manipulation, and on-site detection. As a proof of concept, multiscale sample analysis ranging from nanoscale nucleic acids to microscale bacteria and 3D cell spheroids is realized in the CASE. In summary, this platform offers valuable guidance for customized droplet generation by centrifugal step emulsifiers and promotes the adoption of droplet microfluidics in biochemical assays.","tailored droplet generation crucial droplet microfluidics involve sample varying size . however , absence precise predictive model force droplet platform rely empiricism derived extensive experiment , underscoring need comprehensive modeling analysis . address , novel customized assembled centrifugal step emulsifier case presented incorporating jigsaw puzzle design efficiently acquire large-scale experimental data . numerical simulation utilized analyze fluid configuration step emulsification , identifying key connection tube determines droplet size . training verifying experimental simulation datasets , comprehensive theoretical model established allows preliminary design droplet size generation frequency average error rate 4.8 % , successfully filling critical gap existing field . predictive model empowers case achieve all-in-one functionality , including droplet pre-design , generation , manipulation , on-site detection . proof concept , multiscale sample analysis ranging nanoscale nucleic acid microscale bacteria 3d cell spheroid realized case . summary , platform offer valuable guidance customized droplet generation centrifugal step emulsifier promotes adoption droplet microfluidics biochemical assay ."
39921398,"Viruses exert a profound influence on both human health and the global ecosystem, yet they remain largely unexplored. Precise taxonomic classification of viral sequences is essential for discovering novel viruses, elucidating their functions, and assessing their implications for public health and environmental monitoring. Traditional taxonomy methods based on genome references are limited by the vast number of unexplored viruses, rapid mutation rates, and high genetic diversity. Additionally, highly imbalanced species distribution and significant variances in inter-species genomic distances across taxonomic units pose challenges to classifier training. Conceptualizing genomic sequences as sentences in a natural language, large language models provide novel approaches for extracting intrinsic viral genome characteristics. In this study, we introduce ViTax, a virus taxonomy classification tool powered by HyenaDNA, a large language foundation model for long-range genomic sequences at single nucleotide resolution. ViTax integrates supervised prototypical contrastive learning to address the highly imbalanced distributions across various taxonomic clades and demonstrates superior performance to current leading methods in virus taxonomy, particularly significant for long sequences. Moreover, ViTax designs a belief mapping tree using the Lowest Common Ancestor algorithm to adaptively assign a sequence to the lowest taxonomy clade with confidence. For the open-set problem, where sequences belong to novel and unexplored genera, ViTax can adaptively assign them to a higher level of known taxonomy with outstanding performance. These capabilities make ViTax a robust tool for advancing the accuracy and reliability of viral taxonomy classification.

This retrospective analysis included all elderly individuals with COVID-19 admitted to the Second Medical Center of PLA General Hospital from December 2022 to January 2023. The follow-up period ended on March 30, 2023. During this time, epidemiological, demographic, laboratory, and outcome data were analyzed descriptively. Proteomic sequencing was performed on super-elderly patients who died from COVID-19 at different stages of the disease. A total of 352 elderly COVID-19 patients, with a mean age of 89.84 ± 8.54 years, were included in this study. During a median follow-up period of 98 days, 79 patients died. Deceased patients were older and more likely to have cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases, with a lower prevalence of lipid-lowering therapy. The number of deaths in the acute and post-acute phases were 34 and 45, respectively. Proteomics data suggest that the immune systems of patients who died in the acute phase underwent a more rapid and severe onslaught. Patients in the post-acute phase showed higher levels of viral genome replication and a more robust immune response. However, the over-activation of the immune system led to systemic organ dysfunction. Effective management of comorbidities may improve the prognosis of COVID-19 in super-elderly patients.

39921335,"A variety of classical machine learning (ML) approaches has been developed over the past decade aiming to individualize drug dosages based on measured plasma concentrations. However, the interpretability of these models is challenging as they do not incorporate information on pharmacokinetic (PK) drug disposition. In this work we compare drug plasma concentraton predictions of well-known population PK (PopPK) modeling with classical machine learning models and a newly proposed scientific machine learning (MMPK-SciML) framework. MMPK-SciML allows to estimate PopPK parameters and their inter-individual variability (IIV) using multimodal covariate data of each patient and does not require assumptions about the underlying covariate relationships. A dataset of 541 fluorouracil (5FU) plasma concentrations as example for an intravenously administered drug and a dataset of 302 sunitinib and its active metabolite concentrations each as example for an orally administered drug were used for analysis. Whereas classical ML models were not able to describe the data sufficiently, MMPK-SciML allowed us to obtain accurate drug plasma concentration predictions for test patients. In case of 5FU, goodness-of-fit shows that the MMPK-SciML approach predicts drug plasma concentrations more accurately than PopPK models. For sunitinib, we observed slightly less accurate drug concentration predictions compared to PopPK. Overall, MMPK-SciML has shown promising results and should therefore be further investigated as a valuable alternative to classical PopPK modeling, provided there is sufficient training data.","variety classical machine learning ml approach developed past decade aiming individualize drug dosage based measured plasma concentration . however , interpretability model challenging incorporate information pharmacokinetic pk drug disposition . work compare drug plasma concentraton prediction well-known population pk poppk modeling classical machine learning model newly proposed scientific machine learning mmpk-sciml framework . mmpk-sciml allows estimate poppk parameter inter-individual variability iiv using multimodal covariate data patient require assumption underlying covariate relationship . dataset 541 fluorouracil 5fu plasma concentration example intravenously administered drug dataset 302 sunitinib active metabolite concentration example orally administered drug used analysis . whereas classical ml model able describe data sufficiently , mmpk-sciml allowed u obtain accurate drug plasma concentration prediction test patient . case 5fu , goodness-of-fit show mmpk-sciml approach predicts drug plasma concentration accurately poppk model . sunitinib , observed slightly le accurate drug concentration prediction compared poppk . overall , mmpk-sciml shown promising result therefore investigated valuable alternative classical poppk modeling , provided sufficient training data ."
39921258,"Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) is the most common cyanotic heart defect in neonates. While there is compelling evidence of genetic contribution to the etiology of TOF, the contribution of noncoding variants to the development of the defect remains unexplored. Potentially damaging noncoding de novo variants (NC DNVs) were detected from 141 Chinese nonsyndromic TOF trios (CHN-TOF) and compared to those detected in the Pediatric Cardiac Genomics Consortium (PCGC). Bioinformatic analyses on noncoding and previously detected coding DNVs were performed to identify developmental pathways affected in TOF. Chinese but not PCGC TOF patients showed a notably increased burden of putative damaging NC DNVs (n=249). In Chinese, NC and coding DNVs were predominantly associated with cardiomyocyte differentiation and with chamber/valve/aorta development, respectively, producing a combined enrichment in NOTCH signaling (P=1.1x10-6) and outflow tract morphogenesis (P=2.2x10-5). Genes with NC DNVs (e.g., EFNB2, HEY2 and PITX2) interacted with NOTCH1 and FLT4 in a tight STRING protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. During the in vitro cardiac differentiation process, these noncoding candidate genes, which harbored potentially damaging regulatory NC DNVs, exhibited co-expression with NOTCH signaling genes and demonstrated dysregulated gene expression at various differentiation stages following NOTCH1 downregulation. In summary, our findings highlight a significant contribution of NC DNVs to TOF and suggest the presence of population genetic heterogeneity. Integrative analyses implicate dysregulation of NOTCH signaling, with converging influences from both coding and noncoding variants, in TOF within the Chinese population.","tetralogy fallot tof common cyanotic heart defect neonate . compelling evidence genetic contribution etiology tof , contribution noncoding variant development defect remains unexplored . potentially damaging noncoding de novo variant nc dnvs detected 141 chinese nonsyndromic tof trio chn-tof compared detected pediatric cardiac genomics consortium pcgc . bioinformatic analysis noncoding previously detected coding dnvs performed identify developmental pathway affected tof . chinese pcgc tof patient showed notably increased burden putative damaging nc dnvs n=249 . chinese , nc coding dnvs predominantly associated cardiomyocyte differentiation chamber/valve/aorta development , respectively , producing combined enrichment notch signaling p=1.1x10-6 outflow tract morphogenesis p=2.2x10-5 . gene nc dnvs e.g. , efnb2 , hey2 pitx2 interacted notch1 flt4 tight string protein-protein interaction ppi network . vitro cardiac differentiation process , noncoding candidate gene , harbored potentially damaging regulatory nc dnvs , exhibited co-expression notch signaling gene demonstrated dysregulated gene expression various differentiation stage following notch1 downregulation . summary , finding highlight significant contribution nc dnvs tof suggest presence population genetic heterogeneity . integrative analysis implicate dysregulation notch signaling , converging influence coding noncoding variant , tof within chinese population ."
39921257,"High resolution crystal structure of stimulatory peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligands bound to TCR revealed different conformation of the two peptides at positions P6 and V7 compared to the conformation of the same peptides presented by unliganded MHC. Supercomputer simulation and well-tempered metadynamics approach revealed several meta-stable non-canonical TCR-pMHC interactions that depend on the conformation of the MHC-bound peptides. The diversity of meta-stable states was significantly more represented in signaling TCR-pMHC complex. These findings suggest that TCR-pMHC recognition can be informed by a conformation of peptide presented by MHC that notably influences the orientation of TCR recognizing pMHC ligand. It appears that TCR bound to stimulatory pMHC possess a significantly higher degree of freedom to assume various metastable TCR orientations which are distinct from canonical docking. In contrast, TCR interacting with non-stimulatory pMHC ligand revealed markedly less meta-stable non-canonical interactions and disengaged from the pMHC. This suggests that productive TCR-mediated signaling may depend on non-canonical interactions between TCR and pMHC, either facilitating early recognition events or providing new contacts for catch-bond formation. Our discovery can inform future attempts to simulate the catch-bond formation mechanism in TCR-pMHC recognition, allowing the formation of new bonds mediating alternative peptide presentation.","high resolution crystal structure stimulatory peptide-mhc pmhc ligand bound tcr revealed different conformation two peptide position p6 v7 compared conformation peptide presented unliganded mhc . supercomputer simulation well-tempered metadynamics approach revealed several meta-stable non-canonical tcr-pmhc interaction depend conformation mhc-bound peptide . diversity meta-stable state significantly represented signaling tcr-pmhc complex . finding suggest tcr-pmhc recognition informed conformation peptide presented mhc notably influence orientation tcr recognizing pmhc ligand . appears tcr bound stimulatory pmhc posse significantly higher degree freedom assume various metastable tcr orientation distinct canonical docking . contrast , tcr interacting non-stimulatory pmhc ligand revealed markedly le meta-stable non-canonical interaction disengaged pmhc . suggests productive tcr-mediated signaling may depend non-canonical interaction tcr pmhc , either facilitating early recognition event providing new contact catch-bond formation . discovery inform future attempt simulate catch-bond formation mechanism tcr-pmhc recognition , allowing formation new bond mediating alternative peptide presentation ."

Our results showed that reducing the expression and secretion of PPIA significantly decreased invasion and migration of OC3-I5 cells. Next, we used recombinant PPIA to investigate its direct effect on OC3 cell metastasis. The results revealed that proliferation, migration, and invasion of OC3 cells were significantly increased by treatment with the recombinant PPIA. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed higher PPIA expression in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues. Concisely, PPIA activated the ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways and enhanced cell proliferation and metastasis through CD147.

Understanding the impact of mother-to-neonate gut microbiome and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) transmission is crucial for establishing its role in infants' immunity against pathogens. This study primarily explores mother-neonate ARG transmission through 125 publicly available fecal metagenomes, isolated from eighteen mother-neonate pairs. The core ARGs, detected in both mothers and their respective infants at all stages (birth, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 8th and 12th months) included aminoglycosidases APH(3')-IIIa, Bifidobacterium adolescentis rpoB mutants conferring resistance to rifampicin, β-lactamases CblA-1, CfxA2, multi-drug resistance gene CRP, diaminopyrimidine resistance gene dfrF, fluoroquinolone-resistance gene emrR, macrolide; lincosamide; streptogramin resistance gene ErmB, ErmG, macrolide resistance gene Mef(En2), nucleosidase SAT-4, and tetracycline-resistance genes tet(O), tet(Q), and tet(W).

39921821,"Over the past few years, the tumor microbiome is increasingly recognized for its multifaceted involvement in cancer initiation, progression, and metastasis. With the application of 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid (16S rRNA) sequencing, the intratumoral microbiome, also referred to as tumor-intrinsic or tumor-resident microbiome, has also been found to play a significant role in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Understanding their complex functions is critical for identifying new therapeutic avenues and improving treatment outcomes. This review first summarizes the origins and composition of these microbial communities, emphasizing their adapted diversity across a diverse range of tumor types and stages. Moreover, we outline the general mechanisms by which specific microbes induce tumor initiation, including the activation of carcinogenic pathways, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, epigenetic modifications, and chronic inflammation.

39921808,"The Lewis spider mite (LSM), Eotetranychus lewisi, is an important pest of poinsettias (Euphorbia pulcherrima) and agricultural crops worldwide. In Europe it is a quarantine-regulated pest with established outdoor populations in Portugal. We investigated the pest status and host plants of the LSM in Madeira and the Algarve, collecting and inspecting plants and crops. The LSM was mainly found on naturalized poinsettias and castor-bean. Additionally, live mites were collected in very low numbers from plants of vine, cherimoya, mango, papaya, cherry plum, wild tobacco, and bladder vine, in direct contact or close to LSM-infested poinsettias, strongly suggesting these plants would not be breeding hosts. LSM abundance was low and no damage was observed. Mites were absent from strawberry, bramble and citrus, important hosts worldwide. Field surveys were complemented with a citizen-science experiment in outdoor conditions to test whether proximity to mite-infested poinsettias affected subsequent detections on poinsettia, strawberry, or grapevine. After two months of exposure to potentially dispersing LSM individuals and a further two months under controlled conditions to allow the mite to develop, LSM was detected on the three-recipient species but at low infestation rates, with a higher number of infested leaves and abundance on poinsettias, and absence of damages to crops. Overall, we conclude that the primary reservoirs for LSM populations in southwestern Europe are poinsettia and castor-bean plants, and our results suggest that the LSM is not causing damages to crops and may not be as harmful as expected, which can have implications to the current quarantine-regulation of this mite in Europe.","lewis spider mite lsm , eotetranychus lewisi , important pest poinsettia euphorbia pulcherrima agricultural crop worldwide . europe quarantine-regulated pest established outdoor population portugal . investigated pest status host plant lsm madeira algarve , collecting inspecting plant crop . lsm mainly found naturalized poinsettia castor-bean . additionally , live mite collected low number plant vine , cherimoya , mango , papaya , cherry plum , wild tobacco , bladder vine , direct contact close lsm-infested poinsettia , strongly suggesting plant would breeding host . lsm abundance low damage observed . mite absent strawberry , bramble citrus , important host worldwide . field survey complemented citizen-science experiment outdoor condition test whether proximity mite-infested poinsettia affected subsequent detection poinsettia , strawberry , grapevine . two month exposure potentially dispersing lsm individual two month controlled condition allow mite develop , lsm detected three-recipient specie low infestation rate , higher number infested leaf abundance poinsettia , absence damage crop . overall , conclude primary reservoir lsm population southwestern europe poinsettia castor-bean plant , result suggest lsm causing damage crop may harmful expected , implication current quarantine-regulation mite europe ."
39921774,"The gut microbiota plays a crucial role in the communication between the gut, liver, and brain through the production of short chain fatty acids (SCFAs). SCFAs serve as key mediators in the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis, influencing various physiological processes and contributing to overall health. SCFAs are produced by bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber in the gut, and they exert systemic effects by signaling through various pathways. In the Gut-Liver axis, SCFAs regulate liver metabolism through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPAR-γ), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and other pathways, promotes fat oxidation, modulate inflammation through mTOR pathway, and impact metabolic health. In the Gut-Brain axis, SCFAs influence brain function, behavior, and may have implications for neurological disorders, in which G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) play an essential role, along with other pathways such as hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) pathway. Understanding the mechanisms by which SCFAs mediate communication between the gut, liver, and brain is crucial for elucidating the complex interplay of the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis. This review aims to provide insight into the role of gut microbiota-derived SCFAs as mediators of the Gut-Liver-Brain Axis and their potential therapeutic implications.

39921729,"Emerging research indicates that gut microbiota and the associated immune responses are crucial in the development of chronic inflammatory skin diseases. This investigation employs Mendelian Randomization (MR) and Bayesian weighting to elucidate the causal links between gut microbiota, immune cells, and psoriasis, with a specific emphasis on CD8 + T cells. We leveraged summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) related to gut microbiota, immune cells, and psoriasis. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were chosen as instrumental variables (IVs) to evaluate causal relationships through various MR methods, such as inverse variance weighted (IVW), MR Egger, weighted median, and simple mode. Additionally, Bayesian weighting was used to validate results and account for potential pleiotropy. The IVW analysis revealed significant associations between certain gut microbiota and psoriasis, notably identifying a protective link between Escherichia coli and psoriasis. Further MR analysis demonstrated that Escherichia coli had a causal relationship with CD8 + T cells. Increased levels of CD8 + T cells were associated with a higher risk of psoriasis. BWMR analysis confirmed these findings, showing that CD8 + T cells mediated 10.09% of the protective effect of Escherichia coli on psoriasis. This study underscores the significant role of Escherichia coli and CD8 + T cells in psoriasis, suggesting both protective and exacerbating effects. Understanding these microbiota-immune interactions can lead to the development of more effective, personalized treatments and preventative strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life.","emerging research indicates gut microbiota associated immune response crucial development chronic inflammatory skin disease . investigation employ mendelian randomization mr bayesian weighting elucidate causal link gut microbiota , immune cell , psoriasis , specific emphasis cd8 + cell . leveraged summary statistic genome-wide association study gwas related gut microbiota , immune cell , psoriasis . single nucleotide polymorphism snp chosen instrumental variable iv evaluate causal relationship various mr method , inverse variance weighted ivw , mr egger , weighted median , simple mode . additionally , bayesian weighting used validate result account potential pleiotropy . ivw analysis revealed significant association certain gut microbiota psoriasis , notably identifying protective link escherichia coli psoriasis . mr analysis demonstrated escherichia coli causal relationship cd8 + cell . increased level cd8 + cell associated higher risk psoriasis . bwmr analysis confirmed finding , showing cd8 + cell mediated 10.09 % protective effect escherichia coli psoriasis . study underscore significant role escherichia coli cd8 + cell psoriasis , suggesting protective exacerbating effect . understanding microbiota-immune interaction lead development effective , personalized treatment preventative strategy , ultimately improving patient outcome quality life ."
39921224,"Benthic bacterial communities are sensitive to habitat condition and present a fast response to environmental stressors, which makes them powerful ecological indicators of estuarine environments. The aim of this work is to study the spatial-temporal patterns of benthic bacterial communities in response to contrasting environmental conditions and assess their potential as ecological indicators of estuarine sediments. We characterized the diversity of bacterial communities in three contrasting sites on Sado Estuary (SW Coast, Portugal) and 4 sampling occasions, using 16S metagenomic approach. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized that diversity patterns of bacterial communities will be distinct between sites and across sampling occasions. Bacterial communities were more influenced by each site conditions than by temporal variations in the sediments. The main drivers of bacterial distribution were sediments' composition, organic contents, and hydrodynamic activity. This work provided an important baseline dataset from Sado estuary to explore bacterial networks concerning benthic ecosystem functioning.","benthic bacterial community sensitive habitat condition present fast response environmental stressor , make powerful ecological indicator estuarine environment . aim work study spatial-temporal pattern benthic bacterial community response contrasting environmental condition ass potential ecological indicator estuarine sediment . characterized diversity bacterial community three contrasting site sado estuary sw coast , portugal 4 sampling occasion , using 16 metagenomic approach . based previous study , hypothesized diversity pattern bacterial community distinct site across sampling occasion . bacterial community influenced site condition temporal variation sediment . main driver bacterial distribution sediment composition , organic content , hydrodynamic activity . work provided important baseline dataset sado estuary explore bacterial network concerning benthic ecosystem functioning ."
39920970,"To evaluate the potential differences in plankton diversity and stability within freshwater lake and reservoir ecosystems, this study employed eDNA metabarcoding to analyze the diversity, assembly mechanisms, stability, and environmental drivers of plankton communities in natural water (Y region) and artificial lake water (M region) at Liupanshui Minghu National Wetland Park, Guizhou Province, China. The study revealed notable regional variations in plankton diversity and assembly mechanisms. Specifically, Shannon, Simpson, and Pielou's evenness indices were higher in the M region, suggesting a more complex species composition compared to the Y region. Analysis of community assembly mechanisms indicated that both regions were influenced by a combination of stochastic and deterministic processes, with stochastic processes serving as the dominant driver. Through LEfSe analysis, Random Forest predictions, and molecular ecological network evaluations, certain OTUs identified as ""dual-characteristic"" species were consistently highlighted. These species may play a critical role in shaping community composition and contributing to stability. Environmental drivers further clarified these differences. Redundancy analysis (RDA) demonstrated that TDS was the primary factor driving regional differences in key zooplankton species, while EC and DO were significant factors influencing the distribution of key phytoplankton species. Stability assessments, which combined molecular ecological network analysis and the coefficient of variation in species population density, revealed higher stability in the Y region. This indicates that the natural water system (Y region) has a greater resistance to disturbances compared to the artificial system in the M region. The findings provide fundamental support for assessing the health of aquatic ecosystems, as well as for the effective monitoring and biodiversity conservation of lake and reservoir ecosystems.","evaluate potential difference plankton diversity stability within freshwater lake reservoir ecosystem , study employed edna metabarcoding analyze diversity , assembly mechanism , stability , environmental driver plankton community natural water region artificial lake water region liupanshui minghu national wetland park , guizhou province , china . study revealed notable regional variation plankton diversity assembly mechanism . specifically , shannon , simpson , pielous evenness index higher region , suggesting complex specie composition compared region . analysis community assembly mechanism indicated region influenced combination stochastic deterministic process , stochastic process serving dominant driver . lefse analysis , random forest prediction , molecular ecological network evaluation , certain otus identified dual-characteristic specie consistently highlighted . specie may play critical role shaping community composition contributing stability . environmental driver clarified difference . redundancy analysis rda demonstrated tds primary factor driving regional difference key zooplankton specie , ec significant factor influencing distribution key phytoplankton specie . stability assessment , combined molecular ecological network analysis coefficient variation specie population density , revealed higher stability region . indicates natural water system region greater resistance disturbance compared artificial system region . finding provide fundamental support assessing health aquatic ecosystem , well effective monitoring biodiversity conservation lake reservoir ecosystem ."
39920968,"Microplastics serve as favorable substrates for microbial colonization, promoting biofilm formation, which consequently facilitates the accumulation of pollutants and aids in the degradation of microplastics. Hence, obtaining a thorough comprehension of the factors that influence the development of microplastic biofilms is imperative. Nevertheless, there have been conflicting responses concerning biofilm formation in conjunction with microplastic characteristics and environmental conditions. As a result, a meta-analysis was conducted to quantitatively evaluate the impact of microplastic properties and environmental factors on biofilm formation. The findings indicated that the type and size of microplastics significantly influence biofilm growth on their surfaces. Non-degradable microplastics, particularly polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and polystyrene (PS), exhibited higher surface biomass and biodiversity in microplastic-attached biofilms compared to degradable microplastics. Furthermore, it was observed that smaller microplastics were more conducive to microbial colonization. Model selection and correlation analysis further indicated that the environment acts as a substantial predictor of biofilm formation, with prolonged exposure significantly enhancing microbial diversity within biofilms as opposed to short-term exposure. Moreover, meta-regression analysis illustrated a positive correlation between biofilm biomass and alpha-diversity with temperature, while salinity exhibited a negative correlation in diverse aquatic settings. Notably, the ease of biofilm formation on microplastics was observed to be greater in oceans compared to lakes, yet biofilms exhibited a higher diversity increment in lakes than their oceanic counterparts. In the long-term growth of biofilms, initial biomass and diversity are influenced by microplastic characteristics and the surrounding environment, although environmental influences may assume more significance as time progresses.","microplastics serve favorable substrate microbial colonization , promoting biofilm formation , consequently facilitates accumulation pollutant aid degradation microplastics . hence , obtaining thorough comprehension factor influence development microplastic biofilms imperative . nevertheless , conflicting response concerning biofilm formation conjunction microplastic characteristic environmental condition . result , meta-analysis conducted quantitatively evaluate impact microplastic property environmental factor biofilm formation . finding indicated type size microplastics significantly influence biofilm growth surface . non-degradable microplastics , particularly polyvinyl chloride pvc polystyrene p , exhibited higher surface biomass biodiversity microplastic-attached biofilms compared degradable microplastics . furthermore , observed smaller microplastics conducive microbial colonization . model selection correlation analysis indicated environment act substantial predictor biofilm formation , prolonged exposure significantly enhancing microbial diversity within biofilms opposed short-term exposure . moreover , meta-regression analysis illustrated positive correlation biofilm biomass alpha-diversity temperature , salinity exhibited negative correlation diverse aquatic setting . notably , ease biofilm formation microplastics observed greater ocean compared lake , yet biofilms exhibited higher diversity increment lake oceanic counterpart . long-term growth biofilms , initial biomass diversity influenced microplastic characteristic surrounding environment , although environmental influence may assume significance time progress ."

39920902,"Invasive species present significant management challenges worldwide due to their ability to rapidly adapt to novel environments. The Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, a globally distributed invasive species, arrived in western Sweden in 2006 but has not yet colonised the low salinity waters of the Baltic Sea, presumably because low salinities act as a barrier to reproduction. We used classic mating designs to investigate fertilisation rates and heritability of embryonal salinity tolerance (in 8‰-33‰) in oysters from three locations with different invasion history and salinity (established, 33‰; past invasion front, 23.5‰; and present invasion front, 16‰). We found that fertilisation rates at lower salinities increased with proximity to the range front, with a pronounced heritable component. We then used whole-genome sequencing of oysters from the present invasion front to identify genomic regions showing stronger deviations from Mendelian inheritance in larval full-sib families reared in low salinity compared to controls. These regions contained coding sequences for Histones and ribosomal DNA, with the paternal genotype explaining a significant proportion of the deviation, suggesting the involvement of sperm in modulation of low-salinity tolerance at fertilisation and early development. Furthermore, we found no evidence of recent bottlenecks along the invasion front. We conclude that the Pacific oyster has developed low-salinity tolerant reproductive phenotypes at the present invasion front through acclimation and natural selection. Given the strong heritability for tolerance to low-salinities at fertilisation, the species likely has the potential to adapt further to low-salinity conditions and may invade the Baltic Sea.","invasive specie present significant management challenge worldwide due ability rapidly adapt novel environment . pacific oyster crassostrea gigas , globally distributed invasive specie , arrived western sweden 2006 yet colonised low salinity water baltic sea , presumably low salinity act barrier reproduction . used classic mating design investigate fertilisation rate heritability embryonal salinity tolerance 8-33 oyster three location different invasion history salinity established , 33 past invasion front , 23.5 present invasion front , 16. found fertilisation rate lower salinity increased proximity range front , pronounced heritable component . used whole-genome sequencing oyster present invasion front identify genomic region showing stronger deviation mendelian inheritance larval full-sib family reared low salinity compared control . region contained coding sequence histone ribosomal dna , paternal genotype explaining significant proportion deviation , suggesting involvement sperm modulation low-salinity tolerance fertilisation early development . furthermore , found evidence recent bottleneck along invasion front . conclude pacific oyster developed low-salinity tolerant reproductive phenotype present invasion front acclimation natural selection . given strong heritability tolerance low-salinities fertilisation , specie likely potential adapt low-salinity condition may invade baltic sea ."

39920791,"Despite the approval of several artificial nanotherapeutics for the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), significant challenges, including unsatisfactory therapeutic outcomes, severe side effects, and the high cost of large-scale production, still restrict their long-term application. In contrast, plant-derived extracellular vesicles (PEVs) exhibit promising potential in cancer therapy due to their negligible systemic toxicity, high bioavailability and cost- effectiveness. In this study, we developed an alternative strategy to inhibit TNBC via Platycodon grandiflorum (PG)-derived extracellular vesicles (PGEVs). The PGEVs were isolated by ultracentrifugation and sucrose gradient centrifugation method and contained adequate functional components such as proteins, lipids, RNAs and active molecules. PGEVs exhibited remarkable stability, tolerating acidic digestion and undergoing minimal changes in simulated gastrointestinal fluid. They were efficiently taken up by tumor cells and induced increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to tumor cell proliferation inhibition and apoptosis, particularly in the TNBC cell line 4T1. Additionally, PGEVs facilitated the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) toward M1 phenotype and increased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Further in vivo investigations revealed that PGEVs efficiently accumulated in 4T1 tumors and exerted significant therapeutic effects through boosting systemic anti-tumor immune responses and modulating the gut microbiota whether administered orally or intravenously (i.v.). In conclusion, these findings highlight PGEVs as a promising natural, biocompatible and efficient nanotherapeutic candidate for treating TNBC.","despite approval several artificial nanotherapeutics treatment triple-negative breast cancer tnbc , significant challenge , including unsatisfactory therapeutic outcome , severe side effect , high cost large-scale production , still restrict long-term application . contrast , plant-derived extracellular vesicle pevs exhibit promising potential cancer therapy due negligible systemic toxicity , high bioavailability cost- effectiveness . study , developed alternative strategy inhibit tnbc via platycodon grandiflorum pg-derived extracellular vesicle pgevs . pgevs isolated ultracentrifugation sucrose gradient centrifugation method contained adequate functional component protein , lipid , rna active molecule . pgevs exhibited remarkable stability , tolerating acidic digestion undergoing minimal change simulated gastrointestinal fluid . efficiently taken tumor cell induced increased production reactive oxygen specie ro , leading tumor cell proliferation inhibition apoptosis , particularly tnbc cell line 4t1 . additionally , pgevs facilitated polarization tumor-associated macrophage tam toward m1 phenotype increased secretion pro-inflammatory cytokine . vivo investigation revealed pgevs efficiently accumulated 4t1 tumor exerted significant therapeutic effect boosting systemic anti-tumor immune response modulating gut microbiota whether administered orally intravenously i.v .. conclusion , finding highlight pgevs promising natural , biocompatible efficient nanotherapeutic candidate treating tnbc ."

This study evaluated the effects of tamoxifen citrate on hybrid red tilapia fry growth, reproductive traits, haematological parameters, biochemical profiles, and reproductive hormone levels.A total of 260 swim-up fry (mean weight 0.06 ± 0.04 g) were randomly assigned to four dietary treatments: TA0 (0 mg/kg), TA1 (200 mg/kg), TA2 (400 mg/kg), and TA3 (600 mg/kg), with three replicates of 25 fish each. Fish were fed these diets for 60 days, followed by a 90-day recovery phase in outdoor hapas. The results showed that the male percentage increased significantly with tamoxifen inclusion, reaching 96.83% at 600 mg/kg (P < 0.05). Oestrogen levels decreased, while 11-ketotestosterone increased proportionally with tamoxifen dosage (P < 0.05).

39920351,"Horseshoe bats are natural hosts of zoonotic viruses, yet the genetic basis of their antiviral immunity is poorly understood. Here we generated two new chromosomal-level genome assemblies for horseshoe bat species (Rhinolophus) and three close relatives, and show that, during their diversification, horseshoe bats underwent extensive chromosomal rearrangements and gene expansions linked to segmental duplications. These expansions have generated new adaptive variations in type I interferons and the interferon-stimulated gene ANXA2R, which potentially enhance antiviral states, as suggested by our functional assays. Genome-wide selection screens, including of candidate introgressed regions, uncover numerous putative molecular adaptations linked to immunity, including in viral receptors. By expanding taxon coverage to ten horseshoe bat species, we identify new variants of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2, and report convergent functionally important residues that could explain wider patterns of susceptibility across mammals. We conclude that horseshoe bats have numerous signatures of adaptation, including some potentially related to immune response to viruses, in genomic regions with diverse and multiscale mutational changes.","horseshoe bat natural host zoonotic virus , yet genetic basis antiviral immunity poorly understood . generated two new chromosomal-level genome assembly horseshoe bat specie rhinolophus three close relative , show , diversification , horseshoe bat underwent extensive chromosomal rearrangement gene expansion linked segmental duplication . expansion generated new adaptive variation type interferon interferon-stimulated gene anxa2r , potentially enhance antiviral state , suggested functional assay . genome-wide selection screen , including candidate introgressed region , uncover numerous putative molecular adaptation linked immunity , including viral receptor . expanding taxon coverage ten horseshoe bat specie , identify new variant sars-cov-2 receptor ace2 , report convergent functionally important residue could explain wider pattern susceptibility across mammal . conclude horseshoe bat numerous signature adaptation , including potentially related immune response virus , genomic region diverse multiscale mutational change ."
39921778,"The biodegradation of polyurethane foam (PU foam) using a combination of oxidative pre-treatment (ozonization) and Tenebrio molitor (T. molitor) mealworms was conducted in this study. Different degrees of ozone oxidation (0%, 25%, and 50%) were applied to PU foam, which was subsequently fed to mealworms. The mealworms' survival and growth were then compared to mealworms receiving a normal diet (bran). Results showed that mealworms fed with non-oxidized PU foam (PUF0) exhibited a higher consumption rate (11.8%) than those fed with 25% (PUF25) and 50% (PUF50) oxidized PU foam (7.7% and 5.7%, respectively). The survival rate was similar across all the PU foam diets and the bran diet. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analyses revealed minor structural changes in the PU foam. The gut microbiota analysis showed a significant correlation between the PU foam and bran diets. Among the different oxidized PU, distinct microbial community profiles were also observed, with the genus Klebsiella consistently present across the PU foam diets. The ozone pre-treatment altered the palatability and degradation of the PU foam by mealworms, while the mealworm frass and chitin obtained could potentially be used as resources for agricultural and industrial applications that would close the circular bio-economy cycle.","biodegradation polyurethane foam pu foam using combination oxidative pre-treatment ozonization tenebrio molitor t. molitor mealworm conducted study . different degree ozone oxidation 0 % , 25 % , 50 % applied pu foam , subsequently fed mealworm . mealworm survival growth compared mealworm receiving normal diet bran . result showed mealworm fed non-oxidized pu foam puf0 exhibited higher consumption rate 11.8 % fed 25 % puf25 50 % puf50 oxidized pu foam 7.7 % 5.7 % , respectively . survival rate similar across pu foam diet bran diet . fourier transform infrared ftir spectroscopy differential scanning calorimetry dsc analysis revealed minor structural change pu foam . gut microbiota analysis showed significant correlation pu foam bran diet . among different oxidized pu , distinct microbial community profile also observed , genus klebsiella consistently present across pu foam diet . ozone pre-treatment altered palatability degradation pu foam mealworm , mealworm frass chitin obtained could potentially used resource agricultural industrial application would close circular bio-economy cycle ."
39919579,"Circular bio-based building materials (CBBMs) offer a sustainable solution for reducing the climate impact of buildings and are crucial for transitioning the construction industry towards a circular economy (CE). Reusing, cascading, and recycling municipal biowaste, agricultural by-products, and residues to produce CBBMs can optimise resource utilisation and deliver substantial environmental, economic, and social benefits, as well as promote a circular bioeconomy (CBE). Despite these benefits, the CBBM adoption in the Global South remains limited due to various barriers. Notably, the existing literature lacks research into the current use status and adoption barriers of CBBMs in these regions. This study addresses these gaps by investigating the usage and barriers to CBBM adoption, based on insights from building professionals in Vietnam. Data from 123 valid responses were analysed using descriptive statistics, ranking analysis, and exploratory factor analysis. The findings indicate that ""circular bio-based panels or particle boards"", ""agricultural by-products mixed with clay for wall construction"", and ""circular bio-based concrete, bricks, fillers, or binders"" are the most commonly utilised CBBMs. Government-related barriers, such as ""building code restrictions and lack of regulation"", ""lack of government promotion and incentives"", and ""lack of design guides and tools for projects using CBBMs"", are identified as the most significant obstacles to CBBM uptake. Kendall's W and Whitney U tests reveal a strong consensus among experts, with no significant differences between those with and without firsthand CBBM experience regarding their ranks of barriers. Exploratory factor analysis identified 20 independent barriers, grouped into four components, with the one containing cost and time-related barriers emerging as the most dominant to market and technical-related, government-related, and information and perception-related barriers. The study's findings could provide useful insights for policy recommendations to promote CBBM adoption in Vietnam. These insights may also inform strategies in other Global South countries with similar socioeconomic conditions to facilitate the transition to CE and CBE, mitigating climate change impact, and promoting sustainable development.","circular bio-based building material cbbms offer sustainable solution reducing climate impact building crucial transitioning construction industry towards circular economy ce . reusing , cascading , recycling municipal biowaste , agricultural by-product , residue produce cbbms optimise resource utilisation deliver substantial environmental , economic , social benefit , well promote circular bioeconomy cbe . despite benefit , cbbm adoption global south remains limited due various barrier . notably , existing literature lack research current use status adoption barrier cbbms region . study address gap investigating usage barrier cbbm adoption , based insight building professional vietnam . data 123 valid response analysed using descriptive statistic , ranking analysis , exploratory factor analysis . finding indicate circular bio-based panel particle board , agricultural by-product mixed clay wall construction , circular bio-based concrete , brick , filler , binder commonly utilised cbbms . government-related barrier , building code restriction lack regulation , lack government promotion incentive , lack design guide tool project using cbbms , identified significant obstacle cbbm uptake . kendall w whitney u test reveal strong consensus among expert , significant difference without firsthand cbbm experience regarding rank barrier . exploratory factor analysis identified 20 independent barrier , grouped four component , one containing cost time-related barrier emerging dominant market technical-related , government-related , information perception-related barrier . study finding could provide useful insight policy recommendation promote cbbm adoption vietnam . insight may also inform strategy global south country similar socioeconomic condition facilitate transition ce cbe , mitigating climate change impact , promoting sustainable development ."

There is a growing need for the sustainable agricultural solutions to lessen the reliance on chemical fertilizers; thus, evaluating Bacillus strains as biofertilizers for cotton growth promotion can support eco-friendly and economically viable crop production. Therefore, the growth promoting potential of endophytic Bacillus altitudinis strain TM22 and B. atrophaeus strain MCM61 applied as soil drenching or seed treatment, was evaluated on cotton cv. 'SS32'. In vitro, the qualitative assay both TM22 and MCM61 showed proteolytic, amylolytic, lipolytic, cellulolytic, and chitinolytic activity. TM22 and MCM61 strains also demonstrated the ability to produce siderophores, indole 3-acetic acid (IAA), and phosphate solubilization. In the pot experiment, seed biopriming with TM22 and MCM61 had better performance regarding plant growth and biomass, photosynthetic pigments, stomatal conductance, and relative leaf water contents than the soil drenching application. The gene expression analysis of growth hormones-related genes demonstrated that TM22 and MCM61 showed an upregulated expression of ARF1, ARF18, EXP6, IAA9, GIB1b, and CKX6 while ERF and ERF17 genes were downregulated.

39914116,"High Production Volume Chemicals (HPVCs) are contaminants that pose serious threats to aquatic environments and species that inhabit them, given their massive production and ubiquitous distribution across biological compartments. Among them, organophosphate esters (OPEs) are of particular concern, as they are widely used as plasticizers and flame-retardants, and linked to various forms of toxicity in marine organisms. In this study, we investigated the ecotoxicological response of juvenile gilthead seabream Sparus aurata to the OPE tris (2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCPP) following chronic dietary exposure to three different concentrations (low, D1: 0.2 mg kg-1; ecologically relevant, D2: 2 mg kg-1; and high, D3: 10 mg kg-1). Different biomarkers indicative of antioxidant defence mechanisms (catalase, CAT, glutathione S-transferase, GST, activities), metabolism (citrate synthase, CS, lactate dehydrogenase, LDH, activities) and endocrine disruption (vitellogenin content, VTG), as well as cell (lipid peroxidation levels, LPO) and protein damage (ubiquitin content, UBI) were analyzed in liver and muscle to assess TCPP toxicity. High concentrations of TCPP affected S. aurata growth, but not overall fitness condition. Furthermore, metabolic disruption and severe oxidative damages were observed, regardless of exposure dose. VTG content significantly decreased after exposure to all TCPP dosages, indicating a possible masculinization effect. These findings provide new insights to the scientific knowledge on TCPP ecotoxicological attributes and impacts on marine ichthyofauna.

39910851,"There is a need for ground-breaking technologies to boost crop yield, both grains and biomass, and their processing into economically competitive materials. Novel cereals with enhanced photosynthesis and assimilation of greenhouse gasses, such as carbon dioxide and ozone, and tailored straw suitable for industrial manufacturing, open a new perspective for the circular economy. Here we describe the vision, strategies, and objectives of BEST-CROP, a Horizon-Europe and United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI) funded project that relies on an alliance of academic plant scientists teaming up with plant breeding companies and straw processing companies to use the major advances in photosynthetic knowledge to improve barley biomass and to exploit the variability of barley straw quality and composition. We adopt the most promising strategies to improve the photosynthetic properties and ozone assimilation capacity of barley: (i) tuning leaf chlorophyll content and modifying canopy architecture; (ii) increasing the kinetics of photosynthetic responses to changes in irradiance; (iii) introducing photorespiration bypasses; (iv) modulating stomatal opening, thus increasing the rate of carbon dioxide fixation and ozone assimilation. We expect that by improving our targeted traits we will achieve increases in aboveground total biomass production without modification of the harvest index, with added benefits in sustainability via better resource-use efficiency of water and nitrogen. In parallel, the resulting barley straw is tailored to: (i) increase straw protein content to make it suitable for the development of alternative biolubricants and feed sources; (ii) control cellulose/lignin contents and lignin properties to develop straw-based construction panels and polymer composites. Overall, by exploiting natural- and induced-genetic variability as well as gene editing and transgenic engineering, BEST-CROP will lead to multi-purpose next generation barley cultivars supporting sustainable agriculture and capable of straw-based applications.","need ground-breaking technology boost crop yield , grain biomass , processing economically competitive material . novel cereal enhanced photosynthesis assimilation greenhouse gas , carbon dioxide ozone , tailored straw suitable industrial manufacturing , open new perspective circular economy . describe vision , strategy , objective best-crop , horizon-europe united kingdom research innovation ukri funded project relies alliance academic plant scientist teaming plant breeding company straw processing company use major advance photosynthetic knowledge improve barley biomass exploit variability barley straw quality composition . adopt promising strategy improve photosynthetic property ozone assimilation capacity barley tuning leaf chlorophyll content modifying canopy architecture ii increasing kinetics photosynthetic response change irradiance iii introducing photorespiration bypass iv modulating stomatal opening , thus increasing rate carbon dioxide fixation ozone assimilation . expect improving targeted trait achieve increase aboveground total biomass production without modification harvest index , added benefit sustainability via better resource-use efficiency water nitrogen . parallel , resulting barley straw tailored increase straw protein content make suitable development alternative biolubricants feed source ii control cellulose/lignin content lignin property develop straw-based construction panel polymer composite . overall , exploiting natural- induced-genetic variability well gene editing transgenic engineering , best-crop lead multi-purpose next generation barley cultivar supporting sustainable agriculture capable straw-based application ."

Beyond the well-known macroscopic mushrooms and microscopic yeast, fungi are heterotrophs that feed on almost any organic carbon, recycling nutrients through the decay of dead plants and animals and sequestering carbon into Earth's ecosystems. Human-directed applications of fungi extend from leavened bread, alcoholic beverages and biofuels to pharmaceuticals, including antibiotics and psychoactive compounds. Conversely, fungal infections pose risks to ecosystems ranging from crops to wildlife to humans; these risks are driven, in part, by human and animal movement, and might be accelerating with climate change. Genomic surveys are expanding our knowledge of the true biodiversity of the fungal kingdom, and genome-editing tools make it possible to imagine harnessing these organisms to fuel the bioeconomy. Here, we examine the fungal threats facing civilization and investigate opportunities to use fungi to combat these threats.","past billion year , fungal kingdom diversified two million specie , 95 % still undescribed . beyond well-known macroscopic mushroom microscopic yeast , fungi heterotroph feed almost organic carbon , recycling nutrient decay dead plant animal sequestering carbon earth ecosystem . human-directed application fungi extend leavened bread , alcoholic beverage biofuels pharmaceutical , including antibiotic psychoactive compound . conversely , fungal infection pose risk ecosystem ranging crop wildlife human risk driven , part , human animal movement , might accelerating climate change . genomic survey expanding knowledge true biodiversity fungal kingdom , genome-editing tool make possible imagine harnessing organism fuel bioeconomy . , examine fungal threat facing civilization investigate opportunity use fungi combat threat ."

39908951,"Climate change is increasing marine heatwaves (MHWs) frequency and severity worldwide. These extreme events often cause bivalves' mass mortality and facilitate the growth, proliferation and dispersion of toxin-producing microalgae blooms associated with threats to seafood safety. Yet, the interactive effects between MHW and uptake of marine biotoxins by biota are a novel topic still lacking thorough research, from both the ecotoxicological and seafood safety standpoints. This study assessed the effects of a MHW event on the accumulation/elimination dynamics of diarrhetic shellfish toxins in Mytilus galloprovincialis exposed to Prorocentrum lima and the ecotoxicological responses of mussels co-exposed to these two stressors. Results showed that acute exposure to +4 °C reduced toxins accumulation (-49 %) and elimination (-77 %) compared to control temperature. Moreover, exposure to MHW and toxins affected mussels' antioxidant activity, lipid and protein damage, and metabolism in a tissue-specific manner. These findings highlight that M. galloprovincialis can face higher vulnerability to toxins when MHW events strike.","climate change increasing marine heatwaves mhws frequency severity worldwide . extreme event often cause bivalve mass mortality facilitate growth , proliferation dispersion toxin-producing microalgae bloom associated threat seafood safety . yet , interactive effect mhw uptake marine biotoxins biota novel topic still lacking thorough research , ecotoxicological seafood safety standpoint . study assessed effect mhw event accumulation/elimination dynamic diarrhetic shellfish toxin mytilus galloprovincialis exposed prorocentrum lima ecotoxicological response mussel co-exposed two stressor . result showed acute exposure +4 c reduced toxin accumulation -49 % elimination -77 % compared control temperature . moreover , exposure mhw toxin affected mussel antioxidant activity , lipid protein damage , metabolism tissue-specific manner . finding highlight m. galloprovincialis face higher vulnerability toxin mhw event strike ."
39908902,"Scenario analysis plays a central role in estimating how global changes affect the relationships linking ecosystem conditions and functioning to human needs. This is particularly true for agroecosystems, which are pivotal to ensure sustainable land planning, ecological management and food security strategies. Soils are key providers of multiple ecosystem services (ES) in agroecosystems but they are very sensitive to global drivers such as changes in climate, land use and cover. How agroecosystems should achieve sustainability, through optimizing soil capacity to supply ES while limiting the occurrence of threats, is a priority of EU policy agendas. Nevertheless, there is currently a lack of a comprehensive framework of scenario-based approaches to assess changes in soil ES (SES) and soil threats (ST). As a part of the project SERENA funded by the European Joint Program on Agricultural Soil Management, this study aims to: i) understand how drivers of global change are commonly studied in the scientific literature; ii) identify how some SES and ST are assessed in scenario-based approaches; iii) provide a preliminary discussion on how soil properties are represented in these approaches. Through a systematic review of 230 published articles related to seven SES and ten ST, this study highlights that not all SES and ST are considered with the same frequency and geographic distribution in scenario-based approaches. Despite a great methodological variability in the assessment and mapping of SES and ST, dominant methodological trends can be identified. SES are mapped more frequently than ST and, specific SES appear more disposed to spatially explicit assessments than others. Due to its novelty and complexity, research on this topic is limited to a small subset of ST or SES and projections of the combined impacts of climate, land use and management changes on multiple ST and SES should be a scientific priority to help policy makers.","scenario analysis play central role estimating global change affect relationship linking ecosystem condition functioning human need . particularly true agroecosystems , pivotal ensure sustainable land planning , ecological management food security strategy . soil key provider multiple ecosystem service e agroecosystems sensitive global driver change climate , land use cover . agroecosystems achieve sustainability , optimizing soil capacity supply e limiting occurrence threat , priority eu policy agenda . nevertheless , currently lack comprehensive framework scenario-based approach ass change soil e s soil threat st. part project serena funded european joint program agricultural soil management , study aim understand driver global change commonly studied scientific literature ii identify s st assessed scenario-based approach iii provide preliminary discussion soil property represented approach . systematic review 230 published article related seven s ten st , study highlight s st considered frequency geographic distribution scenario-based approach . despite great methodological variability assessment mapping s st , dominant methodological trend identified . s mapped frequently st , specific s appear disposed spatially explicit assessment others . due novelty complexity , research topic limited small subset st s projection combined impact climate , land use management change multiple st s scientific priority help policy maker ."

39906168,"Despite the transformative power of gene editing for crop improvement, its widespread application across species and varieties is limited by the transformation bottleneck that exists for many crops. The genetic transformation of plants is hindered by a general reliance on in vitro regeneration through plant tissue culture. Tissue culture requires empirically determined conditions and aseptic techniques, and cannot easily be translated to recalcitrant species and genotypes. Both Agrobacterium-mediated and alternative transformation protocols are limited by a dependency on in vitro regeneration, which also limits their use by non-experts and hinders research into non-model species such as those of possible novel biopharmaceutical or nutraceutical use, as well as novel ornamental varieties. Hence, there is significant interest in developing tissue culture-independent plant transformation and gene editing approaches that can circumvent the bottlenecks associated with in vitro plant regeneration recalcitrance. Compared to tissue culture-based transformations, tissue culture-independent approaches offer advantages such as avoidance of somaclonal variation effects, with more streamlined and expeditious methodological processes. The ease of use, dependability, and accessibility of tissue culture-independent procedures can make them attractive to non-experts, outperforming classic tissue culture-dependent systems. This review explores the diversity of tissue culture-independent transformation approaches and compares them to traditional tissue culture-dependent transformation strategies. We highlight their simplicity and provide examples of recent successful transformations accomplished using these systems. Our review also addresses current limitations and explores future perspectives, highlighting the significance of these techniques for advancing plant research and crop improvement.","despite transformative power gene editing crop improvement , widespread application across specie variety limited transformation bottleneck exists many crop . genetic transformation plant hindered general reliance vitro regeneration plant tissue culture . tissue culture requires empirically determined condition aseptic technique , easily translated recalcitrant specie genotype . agrobacterium-mediated alternative transformation protocol limited dependency vitro regeneration , also limit use non-experts hinders research non-model specie possible novel biopharmaceutical nutraceutical use , well novel ornamental variety . hence , significant interest developing tissue culture-independent plant transformation gene editing approach circumvent bottleneck associated vitro plant regeneration recalcitrance . compared tissue culture-based transformation , tissue culture-independent approach offer advantage avoidance somaclonal variation effect , streamlined expeditious methodological process . ease use , dependability , accessibility tissue culture-independent procedure make attractive non-experts , outperforming classic tissue culture-dependent system . review explores diversity tissue culture-independent transformation approach compare traditional tissue culture-dependent transformation strategy . highlight simplicity provide example recent successful transformation accomplished using system . review also address current limitation explores future perspective , highlighting significance technique advancing plant research crop improvement ."

Due to its special qualities, which include high strength, hydrophilicity, and biocompatibility, it is a material that may be used in a variety of industries, especially agriculture. This review explores in this article production processes, post-processing procedures, and uses of nanocellulose in soil fertility increment and sustainable agriculture. A variety of plant materials, agricultural waste, and even microbes can be used to isolate nanocellulose. Nanocellulose is produced using both top-down and bottom-up methods, each of which has benefits and limitations of its own. It can be applied as nano-biofertilizer in agriculture to enhance beneficial microbial activity, increase nutrient availability, and improve soil health. Moreover, nanocellulose can be used in fertilizer and pesticide formulations with controlled releases to increase efficacy and lessen environmental effects. Innovative approaches to sustainable agriculture are provided by nanocellulose technologies, which also support the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially those pertaining to eradicating hunger and encouraging responsible consumption. Nanocellulose promotes climate action and ecosystem preservation by increasing resource efficiency and decreasing dependency on hazardous chemicals, ultimately leading to the development of a circular bioeconomy. Nonetheless, there are still issues with the high cost of production and the energy-intensive isolation procedures.

39900224,"Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) infections, especially methicillin resistant (MRSA), constitute an alarming public health issue due to its association with high mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization costs. The increasing antibiotic resistance and biofilm-associated infections of MRSA prompted the discovery of novel and more effective therapeutic strategies. Our team has been working on alternative therapies against S. aureus infections. For this, we have been repurposing an existing antibacterial drug, rifabutin (RFB), through its association to a nanotechnological platform, liposomes, aiming to promote a preferential targeting to infected sites and maximizing its potential antibacterial effect. The therapeutic potential of RFB formulations against a MRSA commercial strain (MRSA ATCC®-33592), either in planktonic or biofilm forms, was assessed. RFB displayed higher antibacterial effects towards biofilm than vancomycin (VCM), the gold standard treatment against MRSA infections, with MBIC50 values of 103 and > 800 μg/ml, respectively. Moreover, the antimicrobial effect of RFB-loaded liposomes demonstrated to be lipid composition-dependent based on MIC50 and MBIC50 values, which was also confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy. These studies supported that for positively charged RFB liposomes an electrostatic interaction at biofilm surface occurs without internalization. On the other hand, for RFB-loaded liposomes with neutral surface charge a high internalization within the biofilm was observed. Moreover, this RFB liposomal formulation has also demonstrated to be stable in human plasma, as more than 83 % of RFB was still associated to liposomes 24 h after incubation at 37 °C. The proof of concept of RFB formulations was assessed in MRSA systemic murine models of infection. Therapeutic effect and survival rates were evaluated for animals induced and treated with RFB in free and liposomal forms and compared with negative and positive controls. For the lower infection murine model, 100 % survival was achieved for all groups under study.

39899506,"Cultivated raspberries (Rubus idaeus L.) most commonly bear small, red, highly aromatic fruits. Their colour is derived predominantly from anthocyanins, water soluble polyphenolic pigments, but as well as red forms, there exist cultivars that display yellow- and apricot-coloured fruits. In this investigation, we used a multi-omics approach to elucidate the genetic basis of the apricot fruit colour in raspberry. Using metabolomics, we quantified anthocyanins in red and apricot raspberry fruits and demonstrated that, in contrast to red-fruited raspberries, fruits of the apricot cultivar 'Varnes' contain low concentrations of only a small number of anthocyanin compounds. By performing RNASeq, we revealed differential expression patterns in the apricot-fruited 'Varnes' for genes in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway and following whole genome sequencing using long-read Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing, we identified a CACTA-like transposable element (TE) in the second exon of the Anthocyanidin synthase (Ans) gene that caused a truncated predicted ANS protein. PCR confirmed the presence in heterozygous form of the transposon in an unrelated, red-fruited cultivar 'Veten', indicating apricot fruit colour is recessive to red and that it may be widespread in raspberry germplasm, potentially explaining why apricot forms appear at regular intervals in modern raspberry breeding populations.","cultivated raspberry rubus idaeus l. commonly bear small , red , highly aromatic fruit . colour derived predominantly anthocyanins , water soluble polyphenolic pigment , well red form , exist cultivar display yellow- apricot-coloured fruit . investigation , used multi-omics approach elucidate genetic basis apricot fruit colour raspberry . using metabolomics , quantified anthocyanins red apricot raspberry fruit demonstrated , contrast red-fruited raspberry , fruit apricot cultivar varnes contain low concentration small number anthocyanin compound . performing rnaseq , revealed differential expression pattern apricot-fruited varnes gene anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway following whole genome sequencing using long-read oxford nanopore technology sequencing , identified cacta-like transposable element te second exon anthocyanidin synthase an gene caused truncated predicted an protein . pcr confirmed presence heterozygous form transposon unrelated , red-fruited cultivar veten , indicating apricot fruit colour recessive red may widespread raspberry germplasm , potentially explaining apricot form appear regular interval modern raspberry breeding population ."
39896271,"Agrotis ipsilon (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) is a significant pest in Oregon grass seed and vegetable production systems. Effective management of this species relies on timely foliar insecticide applications targeting immature A. ipsilon larvae before crop damage is observed. Regionally specific phenological models serve as a critical component of effective areawide pest management plans to inform the timing of pest monitoring and management action. Seasonal modeling of A. ipsilon phenology is complicated by their migratory behavior and limited knowledge of temperature-dependent development on affected crop hosts. Growth chamber experiments at five constant temperatures (12 to 32°C) were conducted to determine the temperature-dependent development of A. ispsilon life stages on an artificial and perennial ryegrass diet. The completion of one A. ipsilon generation (egg-to-adult) required 658.71 ± 31.49, 601.98 ± 16.01, 648.47 ± 21.35 degree days with a base temperature threshold of 9.8°C for artificial diet, perennial ryegrass diet, and across both diet types, respectively.

39895663,"The evaluation of fruit genetic resources regarding a resistance to pathogens is an essential basis for subsequent selection in fruit breeding. Both genetic analysis and phenotyping of defined traits are important tools and provide decision data in the evaluation process. However, the phenotyping of plants is often carried out 'by hand' and remains the bottleneck in fruit breeding and fruit growing. The development of a digital and UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle)-based phenotyping method for the assessment of genotype-specific susceptibility or resistance against diseases in orchards would significantly increase the efficiency of plant breeding. In this framework, a workflow for drone-based monitoring of pathogens in orchards was developed using the European pear rust (Gymnosporangium sabinae) as model pathogen. Pear rust is widespread in orchards and causes conspicuous, clearly visible, yellow to orange-colored disease symptoms. In this paper, we provide a dataset with expert-annotated high-resolution RGB images with pear rust symptoms. For data collection, ten UAV-flight campaigns were realized between 2021 and 2023 under various weather conditions and with different flight parameters in the experimental orchard of the Julius Kühn-Institute for Breeding Research on Fruit Crops in Dresden-Pillnitz (Germany). 1394 images were captured of different pear genotypes, including varieties, wild species and progeny from breeding. The dataset contains manually labelled images with a size of 768 × 768 pixels of leaves infected with pear rust at different stages of development, labelled as class GYMNSA, as well as background images without symptoms. Each leaf with pear rust symptoms was annotated with the drawing method by two points (bounding boxes) using the Computer Vision Annotation Tool (CVAT, v1.1.0) [1] and presented in YOLO 1.1 file format (.txt files). A total of 584 annotated images and 162 background images, organized into a training and validation set, are included in the GYMNSA dataset.

39895265,"The intestinal epithelium plays a pivotal role as a vital barrier between the external environment and the human body, regulating nutrient absorption and preventing the entry of harmful substances. The human oral exposure to silver nanoparticles (AgNP) raises concerns about their potential toxicity, especially at the intestinal level. The objective of this work was to investigate the potential pro-inflammatory effects of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)-AgNP of two different sizes, 5 and 50 nm, at the intestinal level, while also assessing the protective ability of quercetin against these effects. To address this, an intestinal co-culture model comprising C2BBe1 cells and THP-1 derived macrophages was established, and the effects of 5 or 50 nm PVP-AgNP were studied, alone or in combination with quercetin, over two-time points, 4 and 24 hours. PVP-AgNP, of both sizes, disrupted the barrier integrity within 4 hours of exposure. However, a notable intensification in pro-inflammatory effects was evident only after 24 hours of exposure, especially with smaller PVP-AgNP (5 nm). This resulted in heightened cellular death, increased levels of reactive species, activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-кB), and production of interleukin (IL)-8. Quercetin demonstrates the ability to maintain barrier integrity and mitigate oxidative stress, thereby offering protection against the detrimental effects induced by AgNP at the intestinal level.","intestinal epithelium play pivotal role vital barrier external environment human body , regulating nutrient absorption preventing entry harmful substance . human oral exposure silver nanoparticles agnp raise concern potential toxicity , especially intestinal level . objective work investigate potential pro-inflammatory effect polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp-agnp two different size , 5 50 nm , intestinal level , also assessing protective ability quercetin effect . address , intestinal co-culture model comprising c2bbe1 cell thp-1 derived macrophage established , effect 5 50 nm pvp-agnp studied , alone combination quercetin , two-time point , 4 24 hour . pvp-agnp , size , disrupted barrier integrity within 4 hour exposure . however , notable intensification pro-inflammatory effect evident 24 hour exposure , especially smaller pvp-agnp 5 nm . resulted heightened cellular death , increased level reactive specie , activation nuclear factor kappa b nf-b , production interleukin il-8 . quercetin demonstrates ability maintain barrier integrity mitigate oxidative stress , thereby offering protection detrimental effect induced agnp intestinal level ."

Postbiotics alongside diet, regulate both physical and mental health, as the microbiota members can interact physically with host cells or through secretion of nutrients and metabiotics. These metabiotics also reduce the severity of certain metabolic disorders and support the proper functioning of various organs and systems.

Within their mechanisms of action, Trans-vaccenic acid exerts anti-inflammatory effects and helps alleviate complications associated with metabolic diseases. Indole metabolites promote IL-22 production and regulate epithelial cell proliferation and antimicrobial peptide production. Thiamin is essential for energy metabolism regulation, and butyric acid regulates the brain-gut axis and also regulates immune response.

39921723,"The use of a ketogenic diet (KD) in glioma is currently tested as an adjuvant treatment in standard chemotherapy regimens. The metabolic shift induced by the KD leads to the generation of ketone bodies that can influence glioma cells and the surrounding microenvironment, but the mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we investigated the potential involvement of glial cells as mediators of the KD-induced effects on tumor growth and survival rate in glioma-bearing mice. Specifically, we describe that exposing glioma-bearing mice to a KD or to β-hydroxybutyrate (β-HB), one of the main KD metabolic products, reduced glioma growth in vivo, induced a pro-inflammatory phenotype in astrocytes and increased functional glutamate transporters. Moreover, we described increased intracellular basal Ca2+ levels in GL261 glioma cells treated with β-HB or co-cultured with astrocytes. These data suggest that pro-inflammatory astrocytes triggered by β-HB can be beneficial in counteracting glioma proliferation and neuronal excitotoxicity, thus protecting brain parenchyma.","use ketogenic diet kd glioma currently tested adjuvant treatment standard chemotherapy regimen . metabolic shift induced kd lead generation ketone body influence glioma cell surrounding microenvironment , mechanism yet fully elucidated . , investigated potential involvement glial cell mediator kd-induced effect tumor growth survival rate glioma-bearing mouse . specifically , describe exposing glioma-bearing mouse kd -hydroxybutyrate -hb , one main kd metabolic product , reduced glioma growth vivo , induced pro-inflammatory phenotype astrocyte increased functional glutamate transporter . moreover , described increased intracellular basal ca2+ level gl261 glioma cell treated -hb co-cultured astrocyte . data suggest pro-inflammatory astrocyte triggered -hb beneficial counteracting glioma proliferation neuronal excitotoxicity , thus protecting brain parenchyma ."
39921711,"This review discusses the DNA and RNA methylation pathways and their biological roles in Rosaceae developmental processes relevant for breeding and production. The Rosaceae is a plant family of great importance for human nutrition and health. Many traits and developmental processes of the Rosaceae are influenced by epigenetic methylation, functions of which are now being unravelled in several important species of this family. Methylation of DNA at the 5th position of cytosine (5mC) is a well-established epigenetic mark that affects important cellular processes such as gene expression and genome stability and is involved in a wide range of plant biological functions. Further to this, recent technological advances have uncovered other naturally occurring chemical modifications of DNA and RNA as additional layers of regulatory epigenetic information in plants. In this review we give a comprehensive summary of plant 5-methylcytosine DNA methylation mechanisms and review their components identified in species of the Rosaceae family. We detail and discuss the role of 5mC DNA methylation dynamics in Rosaceae developmental processes, including phase transition, bud development, bud dormancy, plant architecture, plant regeneration, fruit development, ripening and senescence. We then review recent advances in understanding the newly identified nucleic acid modifications, N6-adenosine methylation of DNA (6mA) and RNA (m6A) as additional epigenetic mechanisms. We summarise identified components of adenosine methylation pathways in the Rosaceae and discuss the emerging roles of this modification in plant development including recent findings in Rosaceous species.

39921679,"Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are small cysteine-rich soluble proteins that affect flower and seed development, cuticular wax deposition, and biotic and abiotic stress responses. We isolated an LTP-encoding gene homologous to LTPVAS in Nicotiana benthamiana and designated it LTP-VASCULAR TISSUE SIZE (NbLTPVAS). This gene was expressed in seeds, leaves, roots, and stems. Additionally, NbLTPVAS expression was induced by hypersensitive response (HR)-inducing agents. Cell death was accelerated and the phytopathogenic bacterial population decreased significantly in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants infected with the incompatible Ralstonia solanacearum strain 8107. The expression of HR marker gene hin1 in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants was markedly induced by R. solanacearum 8107, indicative of the acceleration of HR. HR cell death in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants was also promoted by the Agrobacterium-mediated expression of HR-inducing proteins including INF1, AvrA, and PopP1. Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was detected in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants. The expression of NbrbohB (encoding a ROS-generating enzyme) also increased in NbLTPVAS-silenced plants, but the expression of the antioxidant enzyme-encoding genes NbSOD and NbAPX decreased. The silencing of both NbLTPVAS and NbrbohB adversely affected HR induction. Moreover, NbLTPVAS was secreted into the intercellular washing fluid. The transient expression of the full-length NbLTPVAS induced the expression of antioxidant genes, attenuated ROS production, and suppressed the induction of HR cell death. This is the first functional analysis of LTPVAS in plant-microbe interactions.

39921597,"Osteoporosis is divided into primary and secondary types. Primary osteoporosis may result from estrogen deficiency in postmenopausal women, imbalanced bone remodeling in the elderly, or imbalanced adolescent-type bone development. Secondary osteoporosis can be caused by factors like long-term glucocorticoid treatment, chronic kidney disease (CKD), estrogen deprivation, oxidative stress, diabetes, and obesity. This review focuses on the therapeutic potential of soy isoflavones for osteoporosis. At the cellular level, soy isoflavones, as natural plant extracts and phytoestrogens, are crucial for osteoblastogenesis and differentiation, osteoclastogenesis, osteoclast mineralization, and bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation. They also maintain calcium homeostasis by regulating extracellular calcium and vitamin D levels. In terms of oxidative stress, soy isoflavones mitigate it in the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria, thus regulating cellular senescence, autophagy, and bone remodeling processes. Moreover, soy isoflavones can relieve symptoms related to CKD and inhibit glucocorticoid secretion, which directly or indirectly benefits the treatment of osteoporosis. Overall, soy isoflavones have the potential to treat osteoporosis by enhancing bone health, regulating metabolism, and alleviating oxidative stress. Future research should explore the potential of soy isoflavones as phytoestrogens for treating osteoporosis. This exploration should focus on clarifying the safety, identifying potential side effects, determining the optimal dosage regimen, and developing strategies to mitigate any adverse reactions. In addition, further large-scale, multicenter human clinical trials are necessary to accurately evaluate the actual therapeutic effect of soy isoflavones on osteoporosis.","osteoporosis divided primary secondary type . primary osteoporosis may result estrogen deficiency postmenopausal woman , imbalanced bone remodeling elderly , imbalanced adolescent-type bone development . secondary osteoporosis caused factor like long-term glucocorticoid treatment , chronic kidney disease ckd , estrogen deprivation , oxidative stress , diabetes , obesity . review focus therapeutic potential soy isoflavones osteoporosis . cellular level , soy isoflavones , natural plant extract phytoestrogens , crucial osteoblastogenesis differentiation , osteoclastogenesis , osteoclast mineralization , bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cell differentiation . also maintain calcium homeostasis regulating extracellular calcium vitamin level . term oxidative stress , soy isoflavones mitigate endoplasmic reticulum mitochondrion , thus regulating cellular senescence , autophagy , bone remodeling process . moreover , soy isoflavones relieve symptom related ckd inhibit glucocorticoid secretion , directly indirectly benefit treatment osteoporosis . overall , soy isoflavones potential treat osteoporosis enhancing bone health , regulating metabolism , alleviating oxidative stress . future research explore potential soy isoflavones phytoestrogens treating osteoporosis . exploration focus clarifying safety , identifying potential side effect , determining optimal dosage regimen , developing strategy mitigate adverse reaction . addition , large-scale , multicenter human clinical trial necessary accurately evaluate actual therapeutic effect soy isoflavones osteoporosis ."

Proximal small intestine, cecum, and hair samples were collected. Villus length, crypt depth, villus/crypt length, mucin2 and lysozyme-positive cell counts, ZO-1 and occludin gene expression, and intestinal functional permeability were analyzed to assess the intestinal barrier. Blood samples were drawn to assess lipid parameters. Gut microbiome profiling was conducted with DNA from fecal/cecal samples. In addition, we analyzed ZO-1 immunofluorescence in the colon and small intestine. HFD increased MDA, Mucin2, and reduced villus height, crypt depth, villus/crypt length, lysozyme(+)-cell count, and increased intestinal permeability, regardless of MeHg intoxication. MeHg-HFD combination affected the intestinal barrier, decreasing ZO-1, occludin, and Nrf2 transcription, and increased permeability. HFD increased total plasma cholesterol and triglycerides. Only MeHg-HFD reduced microbiome alpha-diversity along with colonic ZO-1 immunolabeling loss compared to non-intoxicated mice fed a control diet. Regardless of diet, the genera Streptococcus, Psychrobacter, Facklamia, and Corynebacterium were severely depleted following MeHg intoxication. Other groups, such as Atopostipes and Jeotgalicoccus, were not altered by MeHg or HFD alone, but were significantly reduced by the combined HFD-MeHg. Synergistic effects of MeHg-HFD on the mucosa-associated microbiota are more pronounced than their individual effects. Our findings suggest that MeHg intoxication does not cause extensive dysbiosis but led to intestinal barrier disruption.","methylmercury mehg markedly toxic human . study explores whether mehg high-fat diet hfd impair intestinal barrier microbiota dysbiosis mouse . weanling mouse fed hfd standard diet 40 day . last 20 day diet , mouse received either mehg 20 mg/l drinking water . proximal small intestine , cecum , hair sample collected . villus length , crypt depth , villus/crypt length , mucin2 lysozyme-positive cell count , zo-1 occludin gene expression , intestinal functional permeability analyzed ass intestinal barrier . blood sample drawn ass lipid parameter . gut microbiome profiling conducted dna fecal/cecal sample . addition , analyzed zo-1 immunofluorescence colon small intestine . hfd increased mda , mucin2 , reduced villus height , crypt depth , villus/crypt length , lysozyme+-cell count , increased intestinal permeability , regardless mehg intoxication . mehg-hfd combination affected intestinal barrier , decreasing zo-1 , occludin , nrf2 transcription , increased permeability . hfd increased total plasma cholesterol triglyceride . mehg-hfd reduced microbiome alpha-diversity along colonic zo-1 immunolabeling loss compared non-intoxicated mouse fed control diet . regardless diet , genus streptococcus , psychrobacter , facklamia , corynebacterium severely depleted following mehg intoxication . group , atopostipes jeotgalicoccus , altered mehg hfd alone , significantly reduced combined hfd-mehg . synergistic effect mehg-hfd mucosa-associated microbiota pronounced individual effect . finding suggest mehg intoxication cause extensive dysbiosis led intestinal barrier disruption ."
39921464,"Bone morphogenetic protein 10 (BMP-10) is crucial for endothelial cell signaling via activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK1), a pathway central to vascular homeostasis and angiogenesis. Dysregulated BMP-10 signaling contributes to cardiovascular diseases and cancer, highlighting the need to control ALK1-mediated endothelial responses to BMP-10 for therapeutic development. BMP-10 biosynthesis involves processing by proprotein convertases (PPCs) resulting in a non-covalently associated prodomain-growth factor (PD-GF) complex (CPLX), similar to other TGF-β superfamily ligands. However, the molecular requirements for BMP-10 bioactivity remain unclear. We investigated how PPC processing impacts BMP-10 structure, bioactivity, and its interaction with the extracellular matrix (ECM) protein fibrillin-1. Molecular dynamics simulations post-in silico cleavage of the BMP-10 dimer model as well as negative staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed that PD processing increases BMP-10 flexibility converting it from a latent wide-angle conformation to a bioactive CPLX which can adopt a V-shape with tighter angle. Only processed BMP-10 demonstrated high potency in HUVEC and C2C12 cells and robust binding to immobilized BMP receptors. Circular dichroism and interaction studies revealed that the N-terminal region of the BMP-10 PD is rich in alpha-helical content, which is essential for efficient complexation with the BMP-10 GF. Binding studies and TEM analyses showed that only the processed BMP-10 CPLX interacts with the N-terminal region of fibrillin-1, causing a conformational change that renders it into a closed ring-shaped conformation. These findings suggest that PD processing induces specific folding events at the PD-GF interface, which is critical for BMP-10 bioactivity and its targeting to the ECM.","bone morphogenetic protein 10 bmp-10 crucial endothelial cell signaling via activin receptor-like kinase 1 alk1 , pathway central vascular homeostasis angiogenesis . dysregulated bmp-10 signaling contributes cardiovascular disease cancer , highlighting need control alk1-mediated endothelial response bmp-10 therapeutic development . bmp-10 biosynthesis involves processing proprotein convertases ppcs resulting non-covalently associated prodomain-growth factor pd-gf complex cplx , similar tgf- superfamily ligand . however , molecular requirement bmp-10 bioactivity remain unclear . investigated ppc processing impact bmp-10 structure , bioactivity , interaction extracellular matrix ecm protein fibrillin-1 . molecular dynamic simulation post-in silico cleavage bmp-10 dimer model well negative staining transmission electron microscopy tem revealed pd processing increase bmp-10 flexibility converting latent wide-angle conformation bioactive cplx adopt v-shape tighter angle . processed bmp-10 demonstrated high potency huvec c2c12 cell robust binding immobilized bmp receptor . circular dichroism interaction study revealed n-terminal region bmp-10 pd rich alpha-helical content , essential efficient complexation bmp-10 gf . binding study tem analysis showed processed bmp-10 cplx interacts n-terminal region fibrillin-1 , causing conformational change render closed ring-shaped conformation . finding suggest pd processing induces specific folding event pd-gf interface , critical bmp-10 bioactivity targeting ecm ."

39921422,"Metasurfaces are the 2D counterparts of metamaterials, and their development is accelerating rapidly in the past years. This progress enables the creation of devices capable of uniquely manipulating light, with applications ranging from optical communications to remote biosensing. Metasurfaces are engineered by rational assembly of subwavelength elements, defined as meta-atoms, giving rise to unique physical properties arising from the collective behavior of meta-atoms. These meta-atoms are typically organized using effective, reproducible, and precise nanofabrication methods that require a lot of effort to achieve scalable and cost-effective metasurfaces. In contrast, bottom-up methods based on colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) have developed in the last decade as a fascinating alternative for accelerating the technological spread of metasurfaces. The present review takes stock of recent advances in the fabrication and applications of hybrid metasurfaces prepared by bottom-up methods, resulting in disordered metasurfaces. In particular, metasurfaces prepared with plasmonic NPs are emphasized for their multifold applications, which are discussed from a biotechnology perspective. However, some examples of organized metasurfaces prepared by merging bottom-up and top-down approaches are also described.

39921382,"Plants accumulate starch and triacylglycerols (TAGs) as carbon sources. Leaves primarily store starch in chloroplasts, with some TAGs stored in lipid droplets, but how carbon resource allocation is regulated in leaves during cellular metabolism is largely unknown. Using a forward genetics approach, we isolated an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant with more lipid droplets in its leaves than the wild type, named lipid rich 1 (liri1). The overaccumulation of lipid droplets was caused by the loss of function in the causal gene, encoding an uncharacterized protein. TAG levels were five-fold higher and starch levels two-fold lower in the leaves of liri1 than the wild type. LIRI1 localized to the chloroplasts, and the contents of chloroplast membrane lipids were 20% higher in liri1 leaves than in wild-type leaves. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that LIRI1 interacts with acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase carboxyltransferase alpha subunit (an enzyme for fatty acid biosynthesis) and starch synthase 4 (an enzyme for starch biosynthesis). In isotope tracer experiments using [1-13C]-sodium acetate, more 13C was incorporated into TAGs in liri1 leaves than in wild-type leaves. Moreover, liri1 plants showed growth defects and irregular chloroplasts. These results suggest that LIRI1 affects the carbon trade-off to inhibit lipid production in leaves.","plant accumulate starch triacylglycerols tag carbon source . leaf primarily store starch chloroplast , tag stored lipid droplet , carbon resource allocation regulated leaf cellular metabolism largely unknown . using forward genetics approach , isolated arabidopsis thaliana mutant lipid droplet leaf wild type , named lipid rich 1 liri1 . overaccumulation lipid droplet caused loss function causal gene , encoding uncharacterized protein . tag level five-fold higher starch level two-fold lower leaf liri1 wild type . liri1 localized chloroplast , content chloroplast membrane lipid 20 % higher liri1 leaf wild-type leaf . co-immunoprecipitation assay revealed liri1 interacts acetyl-coenzyme carboxylase carboxyltransferase alpha subunit enzyme fatty acid biosynthesis starch synthase 4 enzyme starch biosynthesis . isotope tracer experiment using 1-13c-sodium acetate , 13c incorporated tag liri1 leaf wild-type leaf . moreover , liri1 plant showed growth defect irregular chloroplast . result suggest liri1 affect carbon trade-off inhibit lipid production leaf ."
39921338,"Etoposide is an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II, an enzyme essential for DNA transcription, replication, and chromosome segregation. It is well accepted that etoposide triggers cell death due to DNA damage. Our results indicate that multiple molecular mechanisms contribute to etoposide-induced apoptosis, including the overexpression of the mitochondrial voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) and its oligomerization, forming a mega-channel that releases pro-apoptotic proteins, thereby activating apoptosis. Etoposide induces C-terminal truncation of VDAC1 (VDAC1-ΔC) via the proteolytic actions of calpain-1 and asparagine endopeptidase (AEP). A calpain-specific inhibitor effectively prevented etoposide-induced VDAC1-ΔC formation, apoptosis, and the nuclear translocation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Additionally, etoposide upregulates the expression levels of apoptosis regulators (p53, Bax, p21, AIF) and of the proteases calpain and AEP. Etoposide-induced apoptosis and VDAC1 truncation are cell-type dependent and associated with calpain levels and activity. Etoposide-induced VDAC1-ΔC formation and apoptosis are tightly linked: as both display similar patterns of concentration- and time-dependence, both are inhibited by calpain and AEP inhibitors, as well as the VDAC1 oligomerization inhibitor VBIT-4, and are dependent on intracellular Ca2+.

39921458,"Commercially available Dacron (woven polyester) grafts are used for routine open surgical repair of thoracic aortic aneurysms. Despite durable and biocompatible, these grafts do not reproduce the natural mechanical properties of the aorta. Therefore, the aim of this project was to develop an innovative graft that additionally exhibits physiological aortic compliance. To achieve this result, multi-layered tubular aortic grafts were created by electrospinning of a thermoplastic polyurethane. To reduce permeability, a gelatin-coating was added. Three groups (G1-3; n = 5) with varying layer designs were evaluated regarding the main mechanical properties of vascular grafts such as suture retention strength, permeability and static and dynamic compliance. G3, which combined electrospinning with a stable silicone-coated inlay was chosen for the fabrication of medical grade thermoplastic polyurethane grafts (Gm; n = 6). Dynamic compliance values of 19.68 ± 11.5%/100 mmHg (50-90 mmHg), 15.18 ± 8.7%/100 mmHg (80-120 mmHg) and 14.56 ± 7.4%/100 mmHg (110-150 mmHg) were achieved. The compliance was higher than for Dacron and ePTFE grafts and comparable to the normal sized ascending aorta of around 16%/100 mmHg in a healthy human and porcine aortic compliance of 14.3%/100 mmHg. Static compliance was successfully tested up to 350 mmHg. No significant changes in graft diameter or delaminations of the graft layers were detected after compliance testing.

The formed LDH-DC-LOX nanoparticles with a diameter of 55 nm are stable, can be effectively taken up by cancer cells to regulate lactate through both LOX-mediated catalytic conversion and DC-enabled inhibition of extracellular efflux of lactate, and can exert redox metabolism through CDT via Cu2+-mediated glutathione (GSH) depletion and Fenton-like reaction with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) that can be further accumulated via LOX-mediated catalysis. The major advantage of the developed LDH-DC-LOX nanoparticles lies in the therapeutic synergy and cascade that can be achieved through the loaded DC and LOX for enhanced tumor lactate metabolism regulation, for enhanced Cu-mediated CDT and redox metabolism regulation, and for activation of immunotherapy that can further enhances the Cu2+-mediated CDT effect.

39921183,"Magnesium (Mg)-based implants have become an attractive alternative to conventional permanent implants in the orthopedic field. While biocompatibility, degradation kinetics, and osseointegration of Mg-based implants have been mostly investigated, the impact of degradation products on bone remodeling and potential systemic effects remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the early and mid-term local and systemic tissue responses of degrading ultrahigh-purity ZX00 (Mg-Zn-Ca alloy) and ultrahigh-purity Mg (XHP-Mg) pins in a juvenile healthy rat model. The potential differences between implant types (degradable vs. permanent), implantation, and age-related changes were investigated using titanium (Ti), sham-operated, and control groups (non-intervention), respectively. Degradation products of ZX00 and XHP-Mg pins promote osteogenesis in the medullary cavity by upregulating the expression levels of Bmp2 and Opg within 14 days post-surgery. The higher degradation rate of XHP-Mg resulted in the accumulation of degradation products starting from day 3 and upregulation of different genes, particularly Ccl2 and Cepbp. Besides good osseointegration and new bone tissue formation, we found a more parallel hydroxyapatite/collagen orientation along Mg-based pins in the perimeter region compared to Ti pins. In the liver, reduced glycogen levels in Mg-based pins indicated that degradation products promote glycogenolysis, while only the ZX00 group showed a higher serum glucagon level on day 14. Results suggest that degrading ZX00 and XHP-Mg pins stimulate osteogenesis mainly via Bmp2 and Opg and promote glycogenolysis in the liver, while the higher degradation rate of XHP-Mg pins resulted in upregulation of different genes and metabolites.

39921078,"Complement analysis necessitates strict control of pre-analytical blood handling, including time, temperature, and additives. Here, we compared complement function and activation status across five different serum preparations and two plasma preparations. Serum was collected from ten healthy volunteers using glass tubes without additives, tubes with a silica clot activator (with or without a gel separator), and tubes containing thrombin (with or without a gel separator). Plasma was collected in the presence of EDTA or the thrombin inhibitor lepirudin. Serum and plasma aliquots were snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Complement functional analysis was performed using Wieslab and Hycult Biotech pathway-specific assays. Complement activation was determined by quantifying specific activation markers: C1s/C1-INH, MASP-1/C1-INH, C3bc, C3bBbP, and sC5b-9. All serum samples exhibited increased complement activation compared to EDTA and lepirudin plasma, with serum tubes containing thrombin and gel separators showing the highest levels of complement activation. However, normal complement function was observed in all serum preparations, indicating that the complement activation and consumption that occurred did not affect complement functional analysis.

39920742,"Articular cartilage injury is a serious bone disease that can result in disabilities. With the rapid increase in the aging population, this disorder has become an increasingly important public health issue. Recently, stem cell-based cartilage tissue engineering has emerged as a promising therapeutic option for treating articular cartilage damage. Cellular scaffolds, which are among three key elements of tissue engineering, play significant roles in the repair of damaged articular cartilage by regulating cellular responses and promoting cartilage tissue regeneration. Biological macromolecules are commonly used as scaffold materials owing to their unique properties. For example, natural and synthetic polymer hydrogel scaffolds can effectively mimic the microenvironment of the natural extracellular matrix; exhibit high cytocompatibility, biocompatibility, and biodegradability; and have attracted increasing attention in bone and cartilage tissue engineering and regeneration medicine. Several types of hydrogel scaffolds have been fabricated to treat articular cartilage abnormalities.

39920129,"Uncontrolled haemorrhage is a leading cause of trauma-related fatalities, highlighting the critical need for rapid and effective haemostasis. Current haemostatic materials encounter limitations such as slow clotting and weak mechanical strength, while most of bioadhesives compromise their adhesion performance to wet tissues for biocompatibility and degradability. In this study, a molecular self-assembly strategy is proposed, developing a biocompatible and biodegradable protein-based patch with excellent adhesion performance. This strategy utilizes fibrinogen modified with hydrophobic groups to induce self-assembly into a hydrogel, which is converted into a dry patch. The protein patch enhances adhesion performance on the wet tissue through a dry cross-linking method and robust intra/inter-molecular interactions. This patch demonstrates excellent haemostatic efficacy in  both porcine oozing wound and porcine severe acute haemorrhage. It maintains biological functionality, and ensures sustained wound sealing while gradually degrading in vivo, making it a promising candidate for clinical tissue sealing applications.","uncontrolled haemorrhage leading cause trauma-related fatality , highlighting critical need rapid effective haemostasis . current haemostatic material encounter limitation slow clotting weak mechanical strength , bioadhesives compromise adhesion performance wet tissue biocompatibility degradability . study , molecular self-assembly strategy proposed , developing biocompatible biodegradable protein-based patch excellent adhesion performance . strategy utilizes fibrinogen modified hydrophobic group induce self-assembly hydrogel , converted dry patch . protein patch enhances adhesion performance wet tissue dry cross-linking method robust intra/inter-molecular interaction . patch demonstrates excellent haemostatic efficacy porcine oozing wound porcine severe acute haemorrhage . maintains biological functionality , ensures sustained wound sealing gradually degrading vivo , making promising candidate clinical tissue sealing application ."

39918943,"Rapid and accurate detection plays a critical role in improving the survival and prognosis of patients with cardiovascular disease, but traditional detection methods are far from ideal for those with suspected conditions. Metabolite analysis based on nanomatrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (NMALDI-MS) is considered to be a promising technique for disease diagnosis. However, the performance of core nanomatrixes has limited its clinical application. In this study, we constructed 3D flower-shaped cages based on controllable structured metal-organic frameworks and iron oxide nanoparticles with low thermal conductivity and significant photothermal effects. The elongation of the incident light path through multilayer reflection significantly enhances the effective light absorption area of the nanomatrixes. Concurrently, the alternating layered structure confines the thermal energy, reducing thermal losses. Moreover, the 3D structure increases affinity sites, expanding the detection coverage. This approach effectively enhances the laser ionization and thermal desorption efficiency during the LDI process. We applied this technology to analyze the serum metabolomes of patients with myocardial infarction, heart failure, and heart failure combined with myocardial infarction, achieving cost-effective, high-throughput, highly accurate, and user-friendly detection of cardiovascular diseases.

Studies have demonstrated for decades that poly (lactic-co-glycolic acid) [PLGA], a common polymer, has many benefits that make it a strong contender for bone replacement. These include biodegradability, good mechanical qualities, and the ability to induce new bone production. Although calcium-based materials are frequently used as bone fillers in bone implantation, the efficiency of ceramic materials containing calcium may be hampered by a number of issues, including low microporosity and quick rates of degradation. In order to overcome these obstacles, scientists are investigating ways to improve implant performance by combining PLGA with other materials, especially in terms of encouraging improved connections with nearby bone cells. An overview of the chemical properties of different PLGA-based scaffold composites, as well as the benefits and drawbacks of PLGA-Calcium implants in tissue engineering applications, are the goals of this review.

Mammarenaviruses are RNA viruses with an ambisense, bi-segmented genome containing four genes encoding the glycoproteins (GPC), the nucleoprotein (NP), the RNA polymerase (L) and the matrix protein (Z). Several JUNV strains with different pathogenicity have already been fully sequenced. We performed a comprehensive and comparative analysis of their genetic differences and phylogeny, focusing on the synonymous codon usage patterns of the JUNV proteins. We found a nucleotide identity of > 95% between strains, with significant differences between all genes for GC% and Z and L genes for GC3%. Analysis of relative synonymous codon usage showed that codons AGA and AGG of the amino acid arginine were overrepresented, while CGC, CGA and CGG of arginine, GCG of alanine, ACG of threonine, CCG of proline and TCG of serine were underrepresented in the GPC, NP and L genes. A weak codon usage bias was observed, with GPC having a significantly higher effective number of codons. Moreover, selection could explain at least 83% of the observed bias.

We then compared the cellular immune responses of ChAdOx1 recipients and control donors using PBMC collected in 2021 and found that homotypic and heterotypic IFNγ responses were significantly boosted in ChAdOx1 recipients but not controls. Finally, we show that in PBMC derived from blood donors, IFNγ responses are made to both conserved and variable regions of the hexon protein. Future vaccination campaigns using adenoviral vectored vaccines will need to account for the pre-existing exposure of recipients to both circulating HAdVs and vaccines such as ChAdOx1, which convey polyfunctional antiviral T cell responses to even low seroprevalence HAdV types.","human adenovirus hadvs cause diverse disease presentation pathogen also used viral vector vaccine gene therapy product . pre-existing adaptive immune response hadv known influence symptom severity , viral clearance success viral vectored product . note , approximately 50 % uk adult population received least one dose chimpanzee adenovirus vectored sars-cov-2 vaccine chadox1 since january 2021. used fluorospot analysis quantify interferon-gamma ifn interleukin-2 il2 response healthy blood donor hadv specie , b , c , f chimpanzee adenovirus y25 , related hadv specie e. find cellular immune response multiple specie human adenovirus ubiquitous among healthy adult blood donor stimulating pbmc whole hexon peptide library induces significantly greater ifn il2 response using selected peptide pool alone . compared cellular immune response chadox1 recipient control donor using pbmc collected 2021 found homotypic heterotypic ifn response significantly boosted chadox1 recipient control . finally , show pbmc derived blood donor , ifn response made conserved variable region hexon protein . future vaccination campaign using adenoviral vectored vaccine need account pre-existing exposure recipient circulating hadvs vaccine chadox1 , convey polyfunctional antiviral cell response even low seroprevalence hadv type ."

39921602,"The lack of effective antiviral treatments for enteroviruses, including human enterovirus A71 (EV-A71), have resulted in an immense global healthcare burden associated with hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD). Rocaglates and aglains belong to a family of compounds produced by Aglaia genus plants. Since the initial discovery of rocaglates in 1982, various rocaglates and aglains have been synthesized and extensively studied mainly as anticancer agents. Here, we report the discovery of a novel aglain derivative as a potential EV-A71 inhibitor. From an immunofluorescence-based phenotypic screen of a library of 296 rocaglate and aglain derivatives, we identified a lead aglain which effectively suppressed EV-A71 replication by 2.3 log fold at a non-cytotoxic concentration, with a host cell CC50 of 21.78 µM, an EV-A71 infection EC50 of 3.57 µM, and a selectivity index of 6.1.

39921601,"Understanding how interpersonal interactions and immunological factors shape SARS-CoV-2 transmission in households is crucial for designing control measures. We developed a Bayesian data augmentation transmission model to evaluate the effects of isolation, parental care, and vaccine-induced immunity on Delta variant transmission from the follow-up of 1,093 Israeli households (July-August 2021). Among the 2883 household contacts, 1096 (38%) were infected. Children were 38% (CI: 7-81) more likely to be infected than adults. Isolation measures reduced transmission by 52% (CI: 46-57). Transmission was 39% (CI: 11-76) higher between children and adult females than males. Vaccine effectiveness was 78% (CI: 54-90), 85% (CI: 70-94), and 73% (CI: 49-88) for one, two, and three doses of recent vaccination (< 90 days), respectively but dropped to 18% (CI: (-6)-36) for two doses administered more than 90 days ago.

39921518,"Movement disorders after dengue virus (DENV) infection have been increasingly recognized. We aimed to synthesize the clinical and paraclinical characteristics, treatment responses, and outcomes of these neurologic complications. We systematically reviewed PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and LILACS databases up to September 2023 following a published protocol. We identified 73 cases of DENV-induced movement disorders. Cerebellar ataxia was the most common, followed by parkinsonism, opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome, and dystonia. Movement disorders typically developed within 14 days of DENV infection and were associated with a range of neurological symptoms, including cognitive impairment and psychiatric disturbances. Neuroimaging studies frequently showed abnormalities in the basal ganglia and brainstem. Treatment varied depending on the specific movement disorder and included corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, and symptomatic medications. Whereas a handful of cases met the criteria for acute encephalitis, many lacked sufficient data to establish a definitive diagnosis. Para-infectious and postinfectious immune-mediated movement disorders were also reported. A rare case of chronic progressive panencephalitis due to DENV infection highlights the potential for long-term neurological consequences. Other DENV-related complications, such as stroke, pituitary apoplexy, subacute thyroiditis, and metabolic disturbances, can also cause movement disorders. We emphasize the importance of recognizing the diverse neurological manifestations of DENV infection and the need for further research to improve our understanding of the underlying mechanisms and optimize treatment strategies. We propose a more rigorous approach to determining the causality between infection and movement disorder, demanding stronger evidence beyond mere association and advocating for targeted research to fill the existing knowledge gaps. © 2025 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","movement disorder dengue virus denv infection increasingly recognized . aimed synthesize clinical paraclinical characteristic , treatment response , outcome neurologic complication . systematically reviewed pubmed , embase , scopus , lilac database september 2023 following published protocol . identified 73 case denv-induced movement disorder . cerebellar ataxia common , followed parkinsonism , opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia syndrome , dystonia . movement disorder typically developed within 14 day denv infection associated range neurological symptom , including cognitive impairment psychiatric disturbance . neuroimaging study frequently showed abnormality basal ganglion brainstem . treatment varied depending specific movement disorder included corticosteroid , intravenous immunoglobulin , symptomatic medication . whereas handful case met criterion acute encephalitis , many lacked sufficient data establish definitive diagnosis . para-infectious postinfectious immune-mediated movement disorder also reported . rare case chronic progressive panencephalitis due denv infection highlight potential long-term neurological consequence . denv-related complication , stroke , pituitary apoplexy , subacute thyroiditis , metabolic disturbance , also cause movement disorder . emphasize importance recognizing diverse neurological manifestation denv infection need research improve understanding underlying mechanism optimize treatment strategy . propose rigorous approach determining causality infection movement disorder , demanding stronger evidence beyond mere association advocating targeted research fill existing knowledge gap . 2025 international parkinson movement disorder society ."
39921425,"Further phytochemical investigation on the twigs of Trichilia connaroides led to the isolation of nine limonoids (1, 2, and 5-11), one 3,4-seco-homo-cycloartane (3), and two steroids (4 and 12). The structures of these obtained isolates were established by means of detailed analyses of their extensive spectroscopic information and ECD calculations, four of them were elucidated as undescribed compounds (1-4). It is noted that an unprecedented 7-oxabicyclo[2.2.1]-heptane moiety in trichilitin M (1) was proposed by the linkage of C-11 and C-14 via an oxygen atom.  All compounds were evaluated for their anti-tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) activities by the conventional half-leaf method and RT-PCR assays. Compared with the positive control ningnanmycin, compounds 1, 6, 7, and 11 showed signiﬁcant anti-TMV biological activities. Futhermore, qRT-PCR assays suggested that the expression level of the TMV CP gene in inoculated and systemic K326 leaves treated by both 1 and 6, was significantly lower than that for the control group. More importantly, compounds 1 and 6 could not only inhibit the accumulation of TMV CP gene, but also enhance the host plant's resistance to TMV infection.","phytochemical investigation twig trichilia connaroides led isolation nine limonoids 1 , 2 , 5-11 , one 3,4-seco-homo-cycloartane 3 , two steroid 4 12. structure obtained isolates established mean detailed analysis extensive spectroscopic information ecd calculation , four elucidated undescribed compound 1-4. noted unprecedented 7-oxabicyclo2.2.1-heptane moiety trichilitin 1 proposed linkage c-11 c-14 via oxygen atom . compound evaluated anti-tobacco mosaic virus tmv activity conventional half-leaf method rt-pcr assay . compared positive control ningnanmycin , compound 1 , 6 , 7 , 11 showed signicant anti-tmv biological activity . futhermore , qrt-pcr assay suggested expression level tmv cp gene inoculated systemic k326 leaf treated 1 6 , significantly lower control group . importantly , compound 1 6 could inhibit accumulation tmv cp gene , also enhance host plant resistance tmv infection ."
39921395,"During the autumn/winter respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) epidemics, bacterial co-infection is common and affects the disease severity. We aimed to understand the relationship between RSV-bacterial co-infections and clinical severity since the RSV seasonality change after COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted a prospective, sentinel surveillance study at 20 sites in Portugal in children under 2 years hospitalized with RSV, between April 21 and January 23. Effect of co-infection with potentially pathogenic bacteria (PPB) on the length of hospitalization and disease severity was investigated using multivariate linear and log-binomial regression models. Among 678 RSV hospitalizations, 67.4% occurred in children under 6 months and 15.3% in preterm; 20.4% tested positive for PPB; median length of hospitalization was 5 days (IQR: 3-7days). Children coinfected with PPB had a higher rate of ICU admission (29.7% vs. 3.5%, p < 0.001), resulting in more prolonged hospitalizations (7 vs. 5 days, p < 0.001) and a 13-fold risk of having severe disease (RR: 13.2, 95% CI:7.3-23.9). RSV-bacterial co-infection was associated with increased length of hospitalization and severe illness during off-season epidemics. This risk is probably overestimated, as laboratory testing for bacterial infections is usually higher in severely ill-appearing children. Measures to prevent outgrowth of pathogenic bacteria within the respiratory tract should be discussed.","autumn/winter respiratory syncytial virus rsv epidemic , bacterial co-infection common affect disease severity . aimed understand relationship rsv-bacterial co-infections clinical severity since rsv seasonality change covid-19 pandemic . conducted prospective , sentinel surveillance study 20 site portugal child 2 year hospitalized rsv , april 21 january 23. effect co-infection potentially pathogenic bacteria ppb length hospitalization disease severity investigated using multivariate linear log-binomial regression model . among 678 rsv hospitalization , 67.4 % occurred child 6 month 15.3 % preterm 20.4 % tested positive ppb median length hospitalization 5 day iqr 3-7days . child coinfected ppb higher rate icu admission 29.7 % vs. 3.5 % , p < 0.001 , resulting prolonged hospitalization 7 vs. 5 day , p < 0.001 13-fold risk severe disease rr 13.2 , 95 % ci7.3-23.9 . rsv-bacterial co-infection associated increased length hospitalization severe illness off-season epidemic . risk probably overestimated , laboratory testing bacterial infection usually higher severely ill-appearing child . measure prevent outgrowth pathogenic bacteria within respiratory tract discussed ."
39921385,"In recent years, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6) has surpassed enterovirus A71 to become the main pathogen causing severe Hand, Foot, and Mouth disease (HFMD) in China with a substantial disease burden. However, there is currently no commercial CVA6 vaccine. The D3a genotype of CVA6 is the predominant genotype in China. In this study, virus-like particles (VLPs) and mRNA vaccines based on the CVA6 sub-genotype D3a were successfully developed. The immunogenicity and protective effects of the VLP of CVA6 combined with Al(OH)3 and CpG adjuvant indicated that VLP-induced neutralizing antibodies against three CVA6 sub-genotype (D2, D3a, and D3b) strains in Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) mice, and the combination of the two adjuvants enhanced cellular immunity. Passive immunization with serum from mice immunized with VLPs protected suckling mice against CVA6 lethal challenge in both antiserum transfer and maternal immunization experiments. The immunogenicity and protective effects of the mRNA vaccine of CVA6 indicate that it induces robust T-cell immunity. T-cell immunity was found to cross-protect against coxsackievirus A10 infection in mice. This is the first trial of a CVA6 mRNA vaccine worldwide and the first comparison of the immunogenicity and protective effects of VLP and mRNA vaccines based on D3a CVA6. The study provides a theoretical basis for the development of enteroviruses vaccines and the formulation of immunization strategies.","recent year , coxsackievirus a6 cva6 surpassed enterovirus a71 become main pathogen causing severe hand , foot , mouth disease hfmd china substantial disease burden . however , currently commercial cva6 vaccine . d3a genotype cva6 predominant genotype china . study , virus-like particle vlps mrna vaccine based cva6 sub-genotype d3a successfully developed . immunogenicity protective effect vlp cva6 combined aloh3 cpg adjuvant indicated vlp-induced neutralizing antibody three cva6 sub-genotype d2 , d3a , d3b strain institute cancer research icr mouse , combination two adjuvant enhanced cellular immunity . passive immunization serum mouse immunized vlps protected suckling mouse cva6 lethal challenge antiserum transfer maternal immunization experiment . immunogenicity protective effect mrna vaccine cva6 indicate induces robust t-cell immunity . t-cell immunity found cross-protect coxsackievirus a10 infection mouse . first trial cva6 mrna vaccine worldwide first comparison immunogenicity protective effect vlp mrna vaccine based d3a cva6 . study provides theoretical basis development enterovirus vaccine formulation immunization strategy ."
